This book suggests that a real man makes you constantly stumble over your words, bite your lip to refrain from exclaiming adulations, and lose yourself in the sweet smell of his breath. <br><br><strong>3. Are fiercely devoted.</strong> That a girl of no spectacular beauty, who lacks any trace of conversation skills -- whose only virtue is that she smells really yummy -- can inspire an immortal creature of godlike power and grace to alter his entire existence to serve and protect her, watching over her by night (more on that in #4). This is a woman's ultimate fantasy -- to have the perfect man, perfectly devoted, for no good reason at all.<br><br><strong>4. Want them so bad that they won't take them.</strong> This, alas, is the most transparent aspect of this book's appeal. It speaks volumes about the differences between men and women to have so many women toss their bodice-ripping romances aside in order to read how a feral man with otherworldly physical desires can contain his passion and lust out of his pure and perfect love for his beloved. It says that women really do wish they could have it both ways, to be an object of lust and devotion at once, to fulfill a man's desire without actually slaking his thirst for her. To have a man watch you sleep and not want to have even a little peek under the covers -- now that's hot fantasy for today's woman who is otherwise told on a regular basis that to be her best self she has to enage in casual and risky sexual behavior.  <br><br>To see just what an indulgent fantasy this book is, just imagine the male-centric version of Twilight, in which a troubled teen boy moves to a small town to find the hottest girl in town is a vampiress. Such a book would be about 100 pages long (all the unnecessary internal dialogue would be removed). No one would talk except to comment on the awesome size of, um, one's videogame library. The vampiress would be simple: relatively dumb, incredibly hot, wearing almost nothing, and with no expectations of her man but drawn to him only by the smell of his gym bag. She wouldn't hold herself back from trying to bite her intended, but would get so distracted with his bedroom technique that she would never get around to it. <br><br>We would laugh at such a book (in fact, we know it would never be a book since men don't read; it would be a movie, and it would be a smash summer hit called American Vam-Pie-er, I'll start the screenplay right away). Somehow, when this story is told in a similarly indulgent female-centric vein, we don't reject it, but sympathize with it. I believe this is because women get to indulge in their fantasies so rarely outside of Jane Austen novels while men are surrounded with theirs. So far I have yet see spam email inviting one to "read hot things devoted husbands would say to their wives" or "see pictures of hunks promising not to get nasty out of respect for their women" or "buy this purple pill so you can stay up late and share your feelings -- seven times in one night!." So hats off to Stephenie Meyer for figuring out what it is that women really want and giving it to them. <br></span>

I mean, so many people had recommended it to me and I finally got sick of hearing about it, so I picked it up and read it... or as least <strong>tried</strong> to.<br><br>Let me first say that I am a <strong>huge</strong> romance and vampire/supernatural fan, so when I first heard about the book I was really excited to read it because it combined two of my favorite genres.<br><br>But, I really regret ever buying and forcing myself to finish it (I hate not finishing books, even if I hate them), it was so bad. Though, let me tell you that I <strong>really</strong> wanted to like it, really I did... I'm one of those people who likes a lot of popular things, Twilight was popular, so I figured... I would love it just like everyone else, but I was very, <em>very</em> wrong. <br><br>A lot of fans wonder why I hate the book so much and here is my list and it's a pretty long one, so get ready:<br><br>1. Lack of characterization:<br>Bella- Okay... I absolutely <strong>hated</strong> this girl. She was the <strong>worst</strong> female protagonist I have ever read about! She's stupid, shallow, selfish and just plain annoying! Not to mention she's pathetically dependent on Edward... I mean, come on, NO girl should be <strong>that</strong> dependent on a boy, not only is that pathetic, but it is <em>very</em> unhealthy. She was also a clumsy little damsel in distress who was dumb enough to get herself into situations that she couldn't get out of. I would have <em>loved</em> for Meyer to have given her a backbone, so she could have done something useful instead of whining and doing stupid, idiotic things that no remotely intelligent teenage girl would actually do. Not to mention the fact that she is apparently very "plain"  looking... if that's the case then why are there several guys fawning over her? (And, according to Meyer, one of them is a teacher... um, ew). Bella is a Mary Sue, simple as that. And I <em>hate</em> Mary Sues.<br>Edward- Okay, this boy is just <strong>way</strong> too possessive and stalkerish (it is <em>not</em> romantic of him to sneak into Bella's room and watch her sleep! It's creepy and wrong!) Oh, and "bad boys" usually don't sit there and say "I'm dangerous, stay away" etc. all the time... I also hated the fact that Bella described some part of his body every other page. It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Okay, we get the fact that he's hot, Bella... now MOVE ON! <br><br>I could go on and on about all the characters... every single one of them was a flat, cardboard cut-out that did not seem realistic at all.<br><br>2. Writing style:<br>Purple Prose- Ew... to this... seriously, all the purple prose made me want to throw the book across the room. Enough said. <br><br>3. Descriptions:<br>I know I said up there that I got sick of reading about how gorgeous some part of Edward's body was every other paragraph... and if that wasn't bad enough... what's worse than is the fact that even with all that unnecessary description of him and everyone else (though mostly him, since Bella is <em>that</em> shallow) I still had a hard time picturing him or any of the characters in my head, for that matter. I also had a hard time picturing a lot of the setting and the action in my head as well. It's kind of sad really... there was <em>so</em> much description, you would think that everything (Edward especially) would be embedded into my brain, but no. That's what makes me wonder why so many fans find Edward so "hot", I never got a clear picture of him in my head to even begin to form an opinion about whether he was "hot" or not.<br><br>Seriously, Meyer completely abused the dictionary and the thesaurus while writing this book (so much so that I think she should never be allowed to look at either one ever again)... there are so many big descriptive words used that could be replaced by smaller words that look and sound better. Half the time the words that she does use doesn't really go with what she's trying to say. Simply put: Stephenie Meyer is a moron and doesn't know that when writing you are supposed to use the thesaurus <em>sparingly</em> (aka: only when it is <em>truly</em> needed and not any time you damn well please), it really ruins everything if it's used too much... as Meyer has perfectly portrayed with this atrocious book.<br><br>4. Plot:<br>Okay, the plot gets it's own category because it pissed me off so much. I mean, seriously... where was it?! It was nothing but sappy, gag worthy fluff between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something <em>finally</em> happened. And, even then... it went by so fast and was not explained well at all (since Bella conveniently fainted during it, which is such a cop out). It seemed to me that Meyer just threw it in there, and it was only put there in the first place, so that she could point at it and say, "Look, there's a plot right there.", when people like me came around and said otherwise. But that's not a plot!! The plot should not take 400 pages to start! And no the whole "romance" between Bella and Edward is <em>not</em> the plot! This is especially the case since we knew from the beginning... thanks to the moronic give away on the back cover that states that Bella and Edward were going to fall in love... speaking of that, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give away the fact that Edward was a vampire on the back cover?! I mean... really?! That took away any suspense/mystery the book might have had for the reader about what he was... so, while Bella was stupidly wondering what he was, I was sitting there yelling at her for being such a moron and not seeing what was right in front of her.<br><br>5. Plot holes <br>The one thing that drove me absolutely CRAZY was the the fact that no one in the small town of Forks noticed that the Cullens <em>never</em> aged! And the "children" never graduated and went on to college. I mean, if they've been there for more than four years, than I'm assuming that <em>someone</em> would have noticed! I mean, the town could not be full of <em>that</em> many morons! <strong>(Okay... I've been told several times that Cullens have only been living in Forks for about two years... I guess all the purple prose distracted me from reading and remembering that little detail...)</strong> Speaking of school, why in the world would they willingly choose to take high school over and over again? Especially since they all have several college degrees (which leads me to wonder why, since they are so "human loving" they can't do something useful with their education like Carlisle, instead of sitting on their butts all day and just being useless) I know they need to "fit in", but seriously.. . that's just stupid... they could always pretend that they're home schooled (it's not <em>that</em> uncommon these days). Since that's how the Cullens fit into society, that means they have to move every four or five years to avoid suspicion, right? Wow... that must really suck. However, they wouldn't have to do that if they didn't put the younger ones in school since if they were in the workforce (and being useful to society) then they could stay for a lot longer before people started wondering why they don't age. But, I think I know why Edward and his "siblings" tortured themselves day after day by going to high school... Stephenie Meyer wasn't creative enough to come up with any other way for Edward and Bella to meet. It would have made more sense for them to have been neighbors or something. I can come up with several nice ideas about how that would have turned out and it would have been much better.<br><br>I've been told that there are more, but those are the two that really bugged me. Though, I love the fans response to the mention of any plot hole (the rabid ones, not the sane ones, of course). It usually goes like this: "Well it <em>is</em> a fictional vampire book." That's a stupid reason. Just because it's a book with vampires doesn't mean it's exempt from having to be realistic and not having glaring plot holes.<br><br>I've also been told that there are even more in later books, but I'm not about to torture myself by reading the rest of the series just to find them and list them... I have better things to do with my time... like reading books that are actually good and not a waste of my time or money.<br><br>6. Vampires<br>Like I said before, I'm a big vampire fan. But, this book is an embarrassment to vampire fiction. The vampires are pathetic, sweet, innocent, almost "misunderstood" creatures. I know that Meyer has every right to create her own idea about vampires. And, to be honest, I was okay with her idea about vampires until they started sparkling. <strong>VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE</strong>! To have them sparkle takes away the evilness of the myth of the creatures (since, they <em>are</em> creatures of the devil...at least, originally, they were). Evil creatures <em>do not</em> sparkle, the idea's laughable at best. Most normal people are not scared of something that <strong>sparkles in the sun</strong>. I mean, I know if I saw someone sparkling; I would not immediately think "vampire" and run. Not only because I don't associate sparkling with vampires, but also because how the hell is sparkling evil or scary?! By the way, the whole sparkling vampire idea just seemed to be there because Meyer wanted a reason as to why the vampires could even walk around in the daylight to begin with. The idea was just a convenient way for her to write the vampires. Since, she's incapable of coming up with a better, much more creative idea. I don't mind the fact that they could come out during the day (since that's not unheard of in vampire fiction nowadays), but I wish that Meyer had come up with a better idea that didn't make me laugh uncontrollably at the thought. <br><br>All the other myths about vampires are nonexistent. Holy water and garlic won't bother them (just like the sun), stake through the heart won't kill them either, even beheading them won't get rid of them. She made her vampires practically invincible (which is annoying). The only way to really kill one of her vampires is to rip it apart and burn the pieces or to blow it up. Two things that a human would have a hard time doing... which, makes me wonder why, if they're so invincible, they live in secrecy? Especially since (from my knowledge) most vampires don't live like the Cullens, they could careless about humans. If most other vampires were so cruel, why don't they come out to humanity and take over? It makes a lot more sense since a mere human would have a very difficult time killing just one vampire. The fact that they had no weaknesses annoyed the crap out of me. Along with being almost invincible, they all had these special "powers", but they didn't have the bad side effects with them, only the good. All in all, her vampires were perfect.<br><br>I don't like my vampires to be blood thirsty monsters that kill everything in sight. But, I also don't want them to be so pathetic and innocent either. The only two vampiric qualities that are there are the ones that are well known among everyone: drinking blood (well, sort of since the Cullens are "vegetarian" vampires; an idea that seriously made me laugh) and being immortal. Otherwise, the Cullens are disgustingly human like.<br><br>I think the thing I have the problem with the most is the fact that Meyer has never seen any vampire movies/t.v. shows or read any vampire novels. There's this saying in regards to writing: "Write what you know". Stephenie Meyer knew nothing about vampires when she wrote this horrible excuse for a vampire novel (which is probably why it was so awful in comparison to other vampire novels, whether those books are in the romance section of the bookstore or the horror/sci-fi section). A good author always does their research (whether it's fiction or non-fiction is irrelevant). This doesn't mean that she needed to go by the other myths, it just means that she should have done a little research to see what she was getting herself into. If she had done this, I would have been able to respect her ideas more because at least then she would have done her research. <br><br>Where the vampires are concerned, this novel is an embarrassment to vampire/supernatural fiction.<br><br>7. Messages<br>I am somewhat appalled at the messages that this book sends out.. they are so anti-feminist, it's disgusting:<br>1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you. <em>(All Bella wants is to be with Edward, some aspirations, huh?)</em><br>2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot. <em>(Bella goes on and on and on about how <em>hot</em> some part of Edward is every other page)</em><br>3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are <em>so</em> very important. <em>(Mike and Eric pretty much say the same thing to Bella on her first day of school, but she's nicer to Mike than Eric because the latter wasn't very attractive. Also, she picks Edward because of his looks as well)</em><br>4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night (before you even know him all that well)... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. <em>(It's completely disgusting to hear girls talk about this. They swoon and gush about how romantic it is... seriously, what is</em> wrong <em>with people these days?!)</em><br>5. It is perfectly okay to become completely obsessed with your boyfriend and depend on him for <em>everything</em>.<em>(Bella's obsession and dependence on Edward sets feminism back a couple hundred years or so)</em><br>6. It also teaches that not only is it okay to change yourself for a guy, but it's also okay to give up EVERYTHING for him as well. <em>(Bella wants to become a vampire and leave her family and friends to be with Edward. What. The. Hell.)</em><br>7. Your life is not complete until you find a man. <em>(This is nothing but a LIE. Girls do not need a man to be complete)</em><br><br>Like with the plot holes, I've been told that there are many more terrible messages in later books and once again, I'm not about to go out and read the books. However, I will say this... from what I've heard, they sound worse than the ones I've already listed.<br><br>8. The Obsession:<br>Well, this gets its own category, mostly because I just don't understand what all the obsession is over... it's a book, and a poorly written one at that. I run across girls all the time arguing over who Edward "belongs" to... it's pathetic and kind of scary. He's a book character... he doesn't belong to anyone, but Meyer, since she's the one who created him.<br><br>I also hate the fact that I can't go into the book store now without being bombarded with a huge display dedicated to this crappy series... makes me sick to see such praise and popularity for a mediocre book series when there are so much better authors out there that are virtually ignored since they write real fiction and none of this poorly written wish fulfillment fantasy crap.<br><br>This was obviously a fulfillment story that I would expect a preteen to write on her livejournal. This is not a book I would expect a thirty something year old woman with a college education to write and actually attempt and then succeed in getting published. And, it was a degree in English... seriously, I would have expected <strong>much</strong> better from someone who had that degree... since she spent college studying books and analyzing them etc. you would think that she would know how to write one the proper way...<br><br>Meyer could have made this book great, but no... instead she took the easy way out: a cliched, simple, overused plot and added vampires to it(as if that made it any different).<br><br>Honestly, I've read better over on fictionpress.com... and that's really sad, because most of the authors over there are between the ages of 14 and 26 and are amateurs in the field. Maybe, if Meyer had posted this up there first, it would have been a <strong>much</strong> better story because the good writers over there would have set her straight. Maybe then, I would have been able to get through the novel, because it might have actually been good!<br><br>And, oh just for the record... Twilight is <strong>NOT</strong> the next Harry Potter, nor is it better than Harry Potter... I say that not only because JK Rowling actually <strong>has</strong> talent, but also because they are in completely different genres and can't really be compared.<br><br>Though, it <em>does</em> make me sick to see Harry Potter even mentioned in the same sentence as this piece of crap... (unfortunately, that couldn't be avoided in this review) and it's an insult to JK Rowling to have her amazing writing compared to the horrible writing of Stephenie Meyer.<br><br>EDIT: I found this site, and thought I should share with everyone: <a href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/page/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.c...</a><br>The creator of the above site has scanned copies of the Twilight books on to her computer and has taken it upon herself to point out the many issues that the books have (these are mostly grammatical in nature). If you are a fangirl who believes that Twilight is perfect and has no flaws then you should <em>really</em> take a look at this.</span>

  <span id="freeText4639149443095274701" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">I really enjoy lively details. There's nothing better than knowing an author has really <em>thought</em> about her characters and situations, and come up with some surprising and delightful detail that makes the whole reading experience fuller. <em>Lively</em> details, you understand -- <em>pointless</em> details are a nightmare to read. I don't need to know that Bella ate a granola bar for breakfast. I REALLY DON'T. (Notice that I remembered the granola bar. I think this is partly because I was fervently hoping it <em>would</em> have significance. Like, she would spectacularly choke on her oatmeal the next day and think, "AH, I should have had a granola bar like yesterday!")<br><br>"Show, don't tell" is not the be-all-and-end-all of writing. There's a little thing called <em>summary narrative</em>. It's beautiful; it facilitates plot progression without having to follow your narrator through 24-fucking-hours of a day... and "watch" as she eats a fucking granola bar for breakfast.<br><br>I've seen this novel accused of Mary Sue-ism and um, <em>yeah</em>, any character named Isabella Swan seems destined to be a Mary Sue. But honestly, I wouldn't begrudge a semi-autobiographical story if it actually had any of the realism of autobiography. All the high school/teenage stuff honestly made me boggle. Because... that's not what high school is like! That's not what <em>being seventeen</em> is like! <em>Twilight</em> reads like... well, it reads like a thirtysomething who has <em>no</em> recollection of being 17. Bella has all the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old and that's just not remotely believable. <br><br>Meyer is not a bad writer. She has the ability to string words together. Unfortunately, she lacks any kind of flair. There was no original description; no truly evocative language. <em>Twilight</em> reads like Meyer has read a lot of mediocre novels and regurgitated the same kind of language onto the page. There is just nothing <em>exciting</em> to the language. The dialogue is awful: not only uninspiring and lacking in wit, but... it's all the same! There's no difference in speech patterns to the characters; no awareness of personal tics. The characterization is wafer-thin (see above, re: Mary Sue). The plotting is terrible: the novel trundles along at a slow pace for 250 pages and then Meyer seems to suddenly realize she needs a climax and the gears shift abruptly and the reader is caught up in a series of ridiculous contrivances that set up Meyer's final set-piece (which, by the way, I saw coming a mile away).<br><br>This is such a profoundly antifeminist novel. And it's funny, because I think Meyer has no idea that it's antifeminist. I mean, she has a female heroine! A heroine who reads Austen and writes essays about misogyny in Shakespeare! Surely she's kicking butt for all womankind. Um... no. She cooks, she cleans, she looks after the man in her life! She needs male characters to protect her from the big, bad, scary world! She falls headfirst into a disturbingly dysfunctional relationship with a man 90 years her senior without the slightest amount of worry!<br><br>Seriously. Bella/Edward. What's <em>that</em> all about? I don't get the attraction. He has her in his <em>thrall</em>. She is, let me quote, "unconditionally and irrevocably" in love with him -- and after, like, a week. o__O She's consumed by him; she's willing to sacrifice her life for him, and that's... romantic? I just think it's a bit sick, really. You know what I find romantic? Human warmth. Not sweeping, dramatic statements of everlasting and overarching love. Little, sweet moments of connection that ring true. That's something <em>Twilight</em>'s apparently epic love story is sorely lacking in. (Did I say Bella has the emotional maturity of a 32-year-old? Well, except when it comes to Edward. There she has the emotional maturity of a <em>dumb dog</em>.)</span>

  <span id="freeText84241420234807592" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">I actually had to give this book three separate reviews by three sides of my personality. My three-star rating is the median of the three:<br><br><em>Review 1, by My Inner Fifteen Year Old Girl (5 stars):</em><br>Bella is smart, funny, well-read, pretty and yet misunderstood by most of her peers (just like me).  Then she meets a cool, hot guy who turns out to be a good vampire, and he can do really cool things, like run fast and stop cars with his hands, but he's still sweet and wonderful.  It's ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy -- what's not to like?  Meyers can make your heart speed up with some of the tense, tortured "we must be together/no, what if i hurt you" pg-13 erotica.<br><br><em>Review 2, by My Fan of YA Lit (3 Stars):</em><br>Meyers can tell a pretty good story, when she lets herself actually tell it -- the book starts out well, and would have been a bit more interesting if I hadn't known he was a vampire all along.  Then it slows down during the long "getting to know you" dialogue exchanges between Edward and Bella -- there's no plot, just back-story and exposition disguised as conversations, and far too many "I can't be with you, I don't want to hurt you!" "But I love you, I don't care about danger!" back-and-forths.  When the evil vamps show up, however, the story kicks back in and the end is quite exciting.  When Meyers isn't dwelling on how perfectly angelic Edward is (again!) she can get the pages turning.  Since there are A LOT of pages to turn, I wish she would have infused that urgency into the story more often.  While abandoning most of the conventional cliches of vampire-lore (stakes, sunlight, garlic, coffins) she keeps all the modern-vamp-romance cliches (alabaster skin, good hair, expensive taste in clothes, tragically distant), and adds a few of her own unfortunate twists (vampires avoid the sun because it makes them sparkle, the good-vamp clan play some extreme version of baseball in a scene that was far too Quidich-y for my taste).  Too many cliches or trying to hard to be original -- somehow both criticisms are accurate.<br><br><em>Review 3, by My Inner Feminist (1 Star):</em><br>Meyers describes Bella as being strong, brave, and independent, but then shows her as a spineless, cowering victim who needs to be saved by her violently jealous and over-protective boyfriend.  She constantly goes on and on about how Edward is perfect at everything and how he's so gorgeous and she is so unworthy of him, how he's so strong and he protects her.  In fact, she never gives any reason for liking him other than how hot he is, but that's fair because Edward never gives a reason for liking her other than she smells good.  He is frustrated that Bella is the only person whose thoughts he can't read, so he eavesdrops on her friends minds to find out what they talk about, he follows her whenever she leaves her house, and he secretly camps outside her room when she sleeps - that doesn't sound sweet, it sounds creepy.  If girls want a romantic, conflicted vampire/human romance, they should go watch the firs three seasons of Buffy -- not only is there the dark, mysterious, conflicted vampire, but the girl he's in love with can kick some serious ass all on her own.</span>

"i'll try to be careful," i joked, alarmed at the unearthly chill emitted by his taut obliques.<br><br><br>everyone stared at us in the hallway, which was a long interior space allowing access to various doors. the students were wearing clothes and talking and carrying books. through the windows of the classroom which looked onto the out-of-doors, i could see the rain was still raining outside. then i tripped over my clitoris and fell into a galvanized steel av cart on casters. three people were seriously injured.<br><br><br>i chuckled and turn bright red. how embarrassing.<br><br><br>at the end of the school day edward cullen came to walk me to my car. his chest was nowhere to be seen. probably at banana republic or out hunting mountain lions again. i chuckled to myself, darn chest!<br><br><br>"where's my car?" i giggled after chuckling for a while.<br><br><br>"don't you remember that you totaled it this morning when you drove into the orphan's hospital?" he said. he was looking at me with his eyes. he gave me his ivory jacket to keep me dry from the rain, which is usually very wet. then he looked at me again, smiling with the right half of his mouth but frowning with the left half of his mouth and oddly expressionless in the middle part of his mouth.<br><br><br>"you know," i said, falling over a parking bumper into a rack of bicycles, "rain isn't the only thing there is that gets me wet."<br><br><br>"let's just be friends," he hissed, arching an eyebrow, flexing his sinewy wrists, and flaring his beautiful muscular nostrils.<br><br><br>i realized then he might be a vampire. or really gay. or a really gay vampire. <br><br><br>i should have known. he had erasure cassettes in the car.<br><br></span>

I will probably end up reading the rest of them, because if I don't, people that love this thing will think they can convert me if I just keep reading. (<strong>ETA (Jan. 2013):</strong> Never even remotely bothered to finish the series.)<br><br>In short: the writing mechanics are <em>atrocious.</em> The dialogue is stilted and absolutely wretched. The characterization is bad-- loose, jumpy, and the progression is occasionally senseless. The main characters themselves are not compelling: selfish, shallow, lacking the deep thought that comes with true passion and love and instead leaping recklessly into stupid and deadly situations when anyone with a brain could see sixty other possibilities that should have been tried first.<br><br>I can't express my disgust for the relationship between Edward and Bella. It's not romance, it's not passion, it's not love. It's selfish idiocy at best. Bella as a character is insufferable: her self-sacrificing streak is not compassion, it's sheer stupidity. It's hormones. It's a bad, bad example for the teenage girls who read it. Bella's whole life is tied up in her boyfriend. She has no goals, passions, ambitions, or dreams besides wanting to be with Edward, who could kill her.<br><br>Edward's element of danger is occasionally compelling, but it's totally overshadowed by the fact that Bella is completely oblivious to it. She doesn't fear him at all, and that doesn't come off like love: once again, it comes off as total stupidity.<br><br>Edward. What can I say about Edward. There is nothing lovable about him except that he is apparently the most beautiful thing in existence. He's selfish: he stays near Bella when he knows he could lose control and kill her at any second. He's a creepy stalker: he watches her while she sleeps, before she even really knows him. He's volatile: his mood swings are insane and ridiculous. He's immature: for someone who's been alive for a hundred years, he doesn't seem to have gained much experience. He's controlling: he doesn't want to let her out of his sight for two seconds. (Granted, she's dumb enough to get herself killed if he does.) He's insulting: he treats Bella like an incapable, silly little girl. (Which he's right to, but I digress. It's still insulting.)<br><br>I understand that Bella's smell and that Bella herself are irresistible to him. But if he wanted the best for her, he'd stay away from her, period, the end. The story is stupid, the love story is bad, and if that's what Stephenie Meyer is preaching to teenage girls, I think it's pretty questionable. It's not just "a fun read". There are girls out there who want to be Bella and who want to find an Edward.<br><br>Anyway.<br><br>I think I might enjoy the story a lot more if Bella's idiot head was not the one I had to spend time in while reading it. If I had to read one more description of how beautiful Edward is, I was going to choke a kitten. If it had focused more on the vampire family I would have been a lot more willing to forgive its faults. I thought Carlisle's and Alice's stories were really compelling, and Edward was finally accessible to me when he talked about Carlisle turning him into a vampire and how his family came to be formed, his life before Bella, etc. Some aspects of the vampirism were truly awesome: I found the idea that vampires can never sleep completely terrifying. That they never, ever get a break and never, ever get to rest... that is a wonderful and ghastly idea.<br><br>Entirely overshadowed by their flowery breath and the fact that they <em>sparkle.</em> Mothereffing ridiculous.<br><br>This is hardly the tip of the iceberg, but I'm trying to spare you at least a little.</span>

Believe it or not, there are actually a few books that are worse than <em>Twilight</em>.<br><br>Ok, funny story. I was sitting on my couch with my husband last night finishing up <em>Twilight</em>. I slammed the book shut and began rubbing my temples. Then, my husband goes, "So you finally finished, huh?" "Yes. I can't believe I used to like this book," I said. "Hahaha! Yeah, I remember you were on Twilight's <strong>balls</strong> <em>hard</em>." Yeah, yeah, yeah...<br><br>There isn't a single book on my shelf that has fluctuated between all ratings besides <em>Twilight</em>. No, your eyes do not deceive you. I actually have read Twilight 4 times. I used to hail from Shelfari.com and the first rating I ever gave <em>Twilight</em> was 5 stars. After I made the switch to GoodReads, I decided to give it 4 stars instead. So, recently I was browsing my GoodReads shelf (I often do that to clean up ratings), I noticed <em>Twilight</em> was sitting pretty at 4 stars and was on my "favorites" shelf. At the time I thought, "Wow, that's not accurate at all. Maybe it deserves 3 stars?" But I quickly decided, no, no, no...I'll just do a fun little project and re-read the series and give them all better ratings. If your curious about the details of the project, stop on over here: <a href="http://cuddlebuggery.com/2011/09/project-hindsight-because-im-sick-and-masochistic/" rel="nofollow">Project: Hindsight</a>. And hey, if you like what you see, won't you subscribe? Yes? /end shameless self promotion. <br><br>The coolest thing about re-reading <em>Twilight</em> is that it has caused me to create really cool new shelves such as:<br><br>"Kill me now"<br><a href="http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=photo-40.gif" rel="nofollow">

Bella is dull as a doorknob. And the first few chapters of the book are essentially a 'Bitch, Moan, Complain' session. So, we have Bella moving to Forks, WA because she wants her mother to be happy (more on that later). And she's all like, "Ohhhh, I hate this place. It's green. Ewww, it's wet. Fuck my life." And what's one of the first things Bella does when she arrives in Forks? She cooks Charlie dinner. <br><br><a href="http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=9c909d9a.jpg" rel="nofollow">

Well, what the hell was he doing before she arrived?! Oh, ya, did anyone else realize that despite the fact that she says she is not allowed to call Charlie by his first name; she almost always calls him Charlie? WTF. <br><br>Bella goes to school and during lunch she first cast her eyes on the Cullen family. <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[<a href="http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lobshuCQKI1qze5zho1_500.png" rel="nofollow">

 <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span> Her next period happens to be Biology (because that's where you'd meet a vampire, right?) and as she walks past the fan Edward goes: <br><a href="http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=photo-34.gif" rel="nofollow">
  <img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223840/681080.gif" alt="Photobucket" class="escapedImg"></a><br>And she's like, "WTF. Do I smell?" Little does she know that Eddie just wants to devourer her little, ivory skinned ass. His reaction is so off-putting that she cries when she gets back to her truck. All because Eddie doesn't like her.  Who the hell cares, Bella? Conceded much?  Get over yourself. But no, she just obsesses with it. <blockquote>
  <em>"Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Everyday, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens had entered the cafeteria without him."</em>
</blockquote> Meanwhile, poor Mike is trying to put the moves on Bella and invites her to a beach trip. Speaking of the beach trip, here is something the editors should have picked up on. When the beach trip is first brought up it's supposed to be happening in two weeks. But, as Bella goes on and on about nothing in particular, a few pages later she mentions <blockquote>
  <em>"...just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in <strong>a half-dozen weeks</strong>."</em>
</blockquote> Wait, what? Anyone notice something? Six weeks have passed and the beach trip is where? Not only that, but the girl's choice dance was also two weeks away and here six weeks have passed...<blockquote>
  <em>"I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, <strong>almost two months ago</strong>."</em>
</blockquote> Anyway, moving on. Some random shit happens causing Edward to swoop in and save danger prone Bella. The worst thing about <em>Twilight</em> is how incredibly dependent Bella is on Edward. When she's not with him, she is always thinking about him. And that doesn’t make any sense. She barely knows him. They've had like two or three conversations and she has thoughts like: <blockquote>
  <em>"And what was my other choice--to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him."<br>"It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now."<br>"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose."</em>
</blockquote> And then, because Edward must always prove to Bella that he loves her more than she loves him, he pulls this line: <blockquote>
  <em>"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most because if I can do it---if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe."</em>
</blockquote> Are you kidding me? This is not love. But how could it be, with Edward torn between eating her and making out with her? Edward is a controlling creepy creeper. He had been watching her sleep for weeks before they started talking! Meyer are you condoning stalkish behavior?! <a href="http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=photo-47.gif" rel="nofollow">
  <img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380222758/287216.gif" alt="Photobucket" class="escapedImg"></a>Not.Fucking.Cool. <br><br>I once read that Stephenie Meyer had a dream and that is how <em>Twilight</em> was born. She says she actually started writing from chapter 13 (The Meadow) to the ending. <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[Oh, ya, that's where we find out Edward sparkles in the sun! <a href="http://s181.photobucket.com/albums/x95/shellnick2003/?action=view&amp;current=tumblr_lfeah9ZI2S1qes9t9o1_400.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223840/681081.jpg" alt="Photobucket" class="escapedImg"></a> <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span> Then, she went back and wrote the first half. It totally shows. While it's true the entire book is a shit storm in action, the second half is noticeably worse. The first half can easily be summed up as "Bella's Bitch Fest meets Creep-ward" and believe me when I say, it's really not as bad as the second half. How is that even possible? I have no idea, but Meyer pulls that shit off flawlessly. And ya know? I have a theory on that. Because Meyer had a dream about Bella and Edward and their 'true love' and she went to work on the second half before the first, there is all this raw emotions, strange pet names, and banter that's supposed to be romantic but fails miserably. I just felt terribly uncomfortable reading it. And to top it all off, it was so <strong>bad</strong>, like, eye bleeding bad! It made me so angry I actually pulled out a pen and started marking this damn book up. Don't believe me? LMAO, seriously folks, I took notes. Feast your eyes on my personal copy of <s>Toilette</s> <em>Twilight</em> <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[That's French for toilet, stolen from Haleema. But I think the French word works pretty well. Hey, if you say it fast enough it sounds dangerously like Twilight.

She doesn't write fight scenes. There was a huge build up for a fight with James and we see nothing of the fight. Bella is informed of what happened after the fact. Good job, Stephenie.  You totally ripped off your readers there. So, Carlisle is sitting there fixing up Bella on the ground (and he randomly has Morphine, by the way -_-) and Bella is in the process of passing out. But first, Carlisle has a little conversation about Bella's mom and she somehow finds the will to mention to Alice what she knows about James. Like, really? Go to sleep Bella. You talk too much. <br><br>I won't bore you with the details of the ending. I'm sure you already know. But I do want to say that Bella's mother is the most selfish character (next to Bella, of course). First she ships her off to Forks so she could be with her new husband. And no, do not tell me Bella chose to do that. Renee is the parent and it's *her* job to make sacrifices. Then, when Bella is in the hospital after the fight with James, she acts like she can't be bothered to stay with Bella. <blockquote>
  <em>Then she sighed and glaced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall.<br>"Do you need to go?"<br>She bit her lip. "Phil's supposed to call in a little while...I didn't know you were going to wake up..."</em>
</blockquote> Really?? Really, Renee?! Your daughter almost died and you are seriously acting like this? Un-fucking-believable. Oh, but this shit gets better: <blockquote>
  <em>"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know," she announced, proud of herself.</em>
</blockquote> Huh? Do you want a cookie for that? It's your job! <blockquote>
  <em>"I can stay if you need me."<br>"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me."<br>She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay.<br>"I'll be back tonight." Its sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it.</em>
</blockquote> And what does she think Edward and Bella are going to do? She has a broken leg, broken ribs, and cracks in her skull. C'mon now!<br><br>Then Edward takes Bella to prom, he kisses her neck. The fucking end.<br>Would I recommend this? Bahahahahahah! You're shitting me, right?

When I was about a third of the way through, I was so into it that I immediately put my name on the library reservations list for the sequel, and wishlisted every edition on BookMooch. Now, having finished, I doubt I'll bother to read any further in the series. The opening is really quite interesting: Bella moves from sunny Arizona to rainy, gloomy Washington State to live with her father (her somewhat loopy mom wants to follow her new husband while he's <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.on_the_road" title="on the road by Cormac McCarthy">on the road</a> as a minor league ballplayer). To her surprise, she gains almost instant popularity at her new high school—with the exception of the beautiful Edward Cullen and his siblings, who either ignore her, or in the case of Edward himself, seem to be repulsed by her. Even though the reader probably knows going in that at least part of what's going on relates to Edward being a vampire (because it says in BIG LETTERS ON THE BACK that Edward is a vampire), it's still fun to speculate about what <em>exactly</em> is going on—why does Edward seem both drawn and repelled by Bella? Why does he save her life? What are a bunch of vampires doing impersonating students at a small town high school, anyway?<br><br>Unfortunately, the answers to all these questions seem to be either nonexistent or extremely lame. Edward reacts weirdly to Bella because she 1) smells unusually good, and 2) is the only person he's ever met whose mind he cannot read. No. 1 apparently makes him fall in love with her, while the reasons behind No. 2 are never explained. But, you know, the <em>actual</em> mysterious stuff is apparently not important—instead it's more important that we realize that the Cullens are <em>good</em> vampires, who only eat animals, and who do nice, all-American things like play baseball in the woods. Okay! Also, all the weaknesses you've heard vampires have are just myths. Garlic, stakes, even sunlight—no problemo. Yet Edward would never even consider turning Bella, because that would make her an Evil Thing. Oh, and they also can't have sex, presumably because Meyer once read "Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex" (and/or is a Mormon. Sorry).<br><br>Instead, what Edward and Bella apparently CAN do is be very emo and teenage about their twu luv (despite Edward actually being over 100 years old), and be threatened by a villain that shows up in the novel's last third just to give it some semblance of an actual plot. Then, once all is well, they go to the prom! SERIOUSLY. THE BOOK ENDS WITH EDWARD TAKING BELLA TO THE PROM. What. The. Fuck.<br><br>And still, none of this answers my number one question: if you were a century-old vampire, why the HELL would you spend your time going to high school in Washington State? (Especially when you're not even trying to bang high school girls.) Angel at his most pathetic emo mopiness had more spine.</span>

I don't read romance novels*, though, because to me they are lacklustre - Meyer's book has the extra edge I need, though, a great way of keeping doom hanging over the main characters' heads: she's human, he's a vampire.<br><br>Sound corny? Yeah, I know, and the only reason Meyer gets away with it as well as she does is because <em>Twilight</em> doesn't try to be anything it's not, and it has such conviction. Only Meyer could get away with giving her narrator the name Isabella Swan. She says in her little bio at the back that she wanted to write believable characters: an interesting choice, then, to write about vampires, but <em>I</em> believed in them, and without such a willing suspension of disbelief, the story would have been a farce. True, a lot of people <em>haven't</em> been able to suspend their disbelief with this book, but that doesn't affect <em>my</em> reading experience :)<br><br>Seventeen year old Bella's parents are divorced. She lives with her mum in Phoenix, Arizona, and spends time with her dad Charlie in Forks, Washington State, where it rains almost constantly. She hates Forks, but when her mum remarries a baseball player, Phil, and starts travelling with him, Bella decides to move to Forks.<br><br>On her first day at school she notices the isolated group of five beautiful, graceful siblings. Rosalie, Alice, Emmet, Edward and Jasper. One in particular catches her eye: Edward Cullen, with his rust-brown hair and topaz eyes. She is more than a little surprised and shocked when he seems to have developed an acute, profound hatred of her. Her fascination deepens, especially when, after a brief disappearance, he saves her life. She soon figures out what Edward is, and the knowledge doesn't frighten her. The shaky friendship between them develops into something much stronger, and Edward reveals his overpowering reaction to her smell that nearly made him kill her on the spot - hence the look on his face that so shocked her, and the restraint he put on himself during an hour of Biology.<br><br>Let's not forget he's incredibly handsome: even though Bella describes almost every glance he makes and every twitch of his lips, not once did I get bored and roll my eyes. My fascination grew alongside hers, until I too fell in love with Edward - in a totally girly, daydreamy way. Yes, I admit it. I don't know if that makes this a girly kind of book - these days those boundaries don't seem to matter so much, and the vampire family is pretty darn cool, what with Edward's extra ability to read minds, Alice's premonitions, Jasper's ability to affect people's emotions, their speed, their invincibility... Bella is at one point compared to Lois Lane, because Edward and his kin really are like Superman.<br><br>One of the things I love about YA books: the clarity with which they are written. Granted there is some repetition in <em>Twilight</em>, but to me it's necessary repetition. There's nothing superfluous in <em>Twilight</em>, nothing that shouldn't be there, and the flow, the pacing, is great. It's a fat book, but I read it in two days. I read it with breakfast, on my walk to the subway, on the subway, up the escalator, through the ticket gates, to work, in my lunch break ... you get the picture. I couldn't get enough of it, and it left me with that same craving for more that Harry Potter did (I remember scrounging around for loose change as soon as I finished one of them and dashing off into the city to get my next fix. It helped that four were already out when I started). There's plenty of negative stuff you could say about this book - the writing, the characters, the obsession - but again, I couldn't care less :)<br><br>Another thing I loved was all the vampire myths Meyer scrapped. These vampires aren't burnt to ash by sunlight: their marble skin glitters as the sunlight is broken into miniscule shards, like diamonds - hence why they are living in Forks, where the sun hardly ever shines. They are not hurt by crucifixes or stakes through the heart. They do not sleep at all, nor do they eat human food. They drive fast cars really really fast. And they can fall in love. Awwww.<br><br>Seriously though, this was one of most fun, most enjoyable, most romantic books I've read in a long time, and I'm so happy there are two more out with a fourth on the way. They are, somewhat predictably, making <em>Twilight</em> into a movie - still in the early development stage - but it's rather fun to go to the author's website and see her own preferences for actors to play Edward etc. Can't say I'm familiar with most of them, but her top choice (now sadly too old), is indeed a perfect match. Who knows who they'll really cast, but as with the book, the characters have to be right or the whole story will be just silly and sappy.<br><br>_____________________________________<br><br>*Since reading this the first time back in 2007, I've started reading some romance novels. Yes I've been corrupted. Or rather, I've always loved romance stories but had trouble admitting it. Now, I just don't care :)</span>

Before we continue, let's briefly racap <em>Part I of the VCT</em>. Your score in <u>Part I</u> should have given you a good idea of how critically you judge vampire fiction, placing you in either "Group A" or "Group B" based on overall points scored. <br><br><strong><u>Group A</u>:</strong> <br><br>A fairly harsh to extremely harsh critic that requires in a vampire story that it be: (a) well written or at least highly engaging prose; (b) tightly plotted with a well defined backstory that is either tied to an established “vampire mythos” or adds something substantial to the vampire genre; and (c) an intelligent, compelling original story or a slick, fast-paced, chill-filled thrill ride.  <br><br><strong><u>Group B</u>:</strong> <br><br>Includes those that are not too critical and are generally okay as long as the writing and plot are not horrible and there is “something about it” that makes it an interesting diversion. This group also includes those that are not sure what the word critic means.  <br><br>So with Part I completed, we now turn to Part II of the VCT test. In this section, we will take a look at the most popular vampire series in publishing history  (i.e., the Twilight series) and help you determine whether it is a good choice for your next reading selection**. <br><br>**(<strong><u>PLEASE NOTE</u>: If you are part of "Group A" above than the answer is clearly <u>NO</u>, and you can move on immediately to Part III of the VCT.</strong>)  <br><br>For those in Group B, here are the instructions for this section of the VCT. For each of the 4 questions below, select the answer that best describes your personal taste when it comes to vampire fiction. Each answer has a corresponding point value that will be added up at the end of the test. The total number of points will indicate a preference for a certain kind of vampire novel, which can then be used to assist you in selecting the right story for you. <br> <br><strong><u>QUESTION 1</u>:</strong> <em>Which of the following best describes your favorite kind of vampire?</em><br> <br>A: Sparkly, epically EMO and unable to look threatening without legal counsel and a tactical nuke; <u>0 points</u><br> <br>B: Underwear model hotness with perfect hair who smells like the beach and has eyes that can cause a person’s naughty bits to spontaneously combust. <u>5 points</u><br> <br>C: Chalky skin, “super cuts” hair, stylistically challenged clothing (with or without Liberace cape) with long nails, ivory fangs and a kick ass accent. <u>10 points</u>   <br> <br>D. Ugly and reeking of ickyness with deformed monster-like physical appearance and sharp, nasty animal-like teeth and claws. <em>Note:</em> long black tongue like appendages is optional. <u>15 points</u><br> <br>E. So freaking menacing and “out of this world” disgusting that sightings will cause spontaneous development of Tourette Syndrome, loss of bladder and temporary voice immodulation. <u>20 points</u>  <br> <br><strong><u>QUESTION 2</u>:</strong> <em>Which of the following best describes your desire to become a vampire like those in your favorite stories?</em><br> <br>A. YES, YES, oh my God, oh my God, YES…YES…YES…YES…YES….YEEEESSSSS<br><a href="http://s153.photobucket.com/albums/s207/sullypython/Hollywood%20moviess/?action=view&amp;current=ryan460-1-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">
  <img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223840/681073.jpg" alt="Photobucket" class="escapedImg"></a><br> <u>0 points</u><br> <br>B. Yes, I think it would be pretty cool.  <u>5 points</u><br> <br>C. Close, but no. I think the loneliness, lack of Vitamin D and dietary restrictions outweigh the longevity and the cool, soulful hipness. <u>10 points</u><br> <br>D. No way,  I would rather die than become one of those things. <u>15 points</u><br> <br>E. <strong>ARE YOU FUCKING PSYCHO</strong>? Not only would I rather die but I would personally hogtie my best friends and leave them for the creatures to munch on while I made good my escape. <u>20 points</u><br> <br><strong><u>QUESTION 3</u>:</strong> <em>Which of the following best describes how you would respond if a casual acquaintance asked you if they should check out the popular “Twilight” series by Stephenie Meyer?</em><br> <br>A. I would say YES because it is the best book since Crime and Punishment, no wait, the BEST BOOK EVER and everyone should read it. <u>0 points</u><br> <br>B. I would say YES, but would spend the next 20 minutes qualifying my answer using phrases like: “well, some people find it kinda cheesy” and “it’s not exactly quality prose” and “you should know that I’m pretty forgiving of the plot because I just LOVE the characters” and “don’t fucking look at me like that. I mean, it sold like a gagillion copies so it can’t be all bad.” <u>5 points</u><br> <br>C. Even though I really like it, I would be too embarrassed to admit that I read it and would tell the person NO and that they should to read Ulysses instead because “it is like way deep and shit.” <u>10 points</u><br><br>D. I would say NO and tell them to go read Dracula because it’s an excellent Vampire story!! <u>15 points</u><br> <br>E. I would stare at them stunned for several seconds and then bitch slap them hard across the face for asking me such a dumb shit question, screaming that vampires DO NOT sparkle, wear hair gel or play baseball....EVER!!! <u>20 points</u><br><br><strong><u>QUESTION 4</u>:</strong> If they made a major hollywood movie of your favorite vampire movie, what rating would the MPAA give it?<br><br>A. PG to PG-13 for <s>EMO</s> Adult situations, <s>snarky</s> Adult language and <s>boring</s> violence. <u>0 points</u><br><br>B. PG-13 for strong sexual situations, strong sexual situations and strong to very strong sexual situations. <u>5 points</u><br><br>C. R for Adult language, sweet, bloody violence, fright and nudity followed by bimbo deaths. <u>10 points</u><br><br>D. NC-17 to banned in the U.S. for almost continuous gore on a massive scale, vampires more disgusting than a SUMO wrestler's bowel movement and.......lots and lots of nudity because WHY NOT. <u>15 points</u><br><br><strong>SCORING FOR PART II OF VCT:</strong><br><br>0 to 10 points. Ignore the 1 star rating above, buy "first printings" of all four of the Twilight books and read them over and over until your eyes bleed. <br><br>15 to 20 points. Twilight is probably a 2 star read and you might think about squeezing it in between episodes of “Jersey Shore.”<br><br>25 to 50 points. Best to skip Twilight as it is not likely to be a memorable read for you. <br><br>50 points or over. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Twilight is your vampire kryptonite and reading it will make you think less of yourself and may cause severe and long lasting anger and/or depression at the current state of the world.  <br><br><strong> REVIEW NOTES AND COMMENTS:</strong><br><br>* An apology for this review to my wife who loves these books. <br><br>** An apology to my two beautiful daughters for telling them that mommy "had problems" for loving these books. <br><br>*** Three cheers for my beautiful wife for "getting" that I was just trying to be funny in doing this review and didn't mean all the things I wrote....(whew).</span>

"ballet bar", "dust moats", "had been belonged to me". OMFG SRSLY stephenie, you can't afford a copy editor?? and while we are at it - your name is also a typo. and there is so much chuckling and tooth grinding and fist balling (heh) and jaw clenching it seems like a ticcy nicolas cage movie at times. and the repetition of words for edward; "beautiful" and "heavenly" and "sublime" and "perfect" "perfect" "perfect". christmas wishlist: a thesaurus for stephenie.<br><br>but more than that.<br><br>from what i had heard - the big complaint about this book was bella. i was expecting some vapid, swoony, clumsy, clingy, weak little thing who was a terrible role model for the young misses and a blight upon the face of womynhood. but she is actually pretty badass. she drives a massive truck and is good at science and likes to read and hates the prom and is pretty fearless and would hook a finger in your eye and pop it out instead of running away if she felt threatened. i can get behind that. <br><br>so what are the complaints <em>actually</em> about?? her selfless devotion to edward; her willingness to sacrifice and surrender herself for a boy. a vampire. a much older man. a creature known for its powers of mesmerism and allure.<br><br>the ultimate bad boy.<br><br>well, duh! <br><br>this is <strong>precisely</strong> how it feels to be a 17-year-old girl deeply in love. it's fight, kill, or die for your beloved. see, i <em>was</em> one, so i can speak to the phenomenon firsthand. and from here on out, if it makes you feel more comfortable; if you have a problem with sweeping generalities, when i use the phrase "17-year-old-girl", feel free to substitute "karen t. brissette"<br><br>17-year-old girls are drawn to the bad boy<br><br>17-year-old girls in love do not think, they feel<br><br>17-year-old girls are dangerously self-absorbed (when "self" includes the beloved because they are one soul etc etc) <br><br>17-year-old girls do not give one shit about what kind of example they are setting for others of their gender<br><br>17-year-old girls are all too inclined to sacrifice,to become a martyr for their love, to believe in the magic of the world and the power of infatuation, and to risk it all to prolong that infatuation<br><br>17-year-old girls lack cynicism and have no real frame of reference yet or any extensive battle scars, or relationship track record; everything is here and now and the most important thing in the history of the world.<br><br>so, yeah, bella, i get you. you are not a victim. and your clumsiness (and mine) are very endearing.as is your commitment. i once walked miles barefoot on the summer blacktop to show my devotion to mine, he pulled equally stupid demonstrative stunts - there were blowups and reconciliations and third-party interventions and i <em>became</em> love and it was wonderful, mercurial, mad mad mad.<br><br>so,yeah, bells, i get your depth of feeling.<br><br>forget team edward<br>forget team jacob<br>i am resoundingly team bella.<br><br>and i was also told this was one of the most erotic novels of all time, by my most favorite professor, and i rolled my eyes at the time, thinking "why does everyone like this damn book so much??"but you know what?? she was right. this is totally virgin porn. straight up sweaty virgin porn.<br><br>and of course, <em>all</em> vampire lit is porn, where the bloodsucking stands in for the sex act etc etc. but what if both parties are acting against nature/their inclinations?<br><br>he is repressing his desire to drink her blood<br><br>she is repressing her desire to touch him<br><br>both feel the strain of resistance and every time they are close - there is amazing heightened tension.and it is - it is pretty damn hot.<br><br>hoofa.<br><br><br>so, yeah, like cottage cheese, i have come around in my thinking about this book. but i refuse to give this a star rating. let me hold on to that much of my pride.<br><br><br></span>

It’s through them that the plot is developed, the conflicts are carried, the climax is revealed, stuff like that. And when you’re writing in a first person POV, you have to make that “first person” interesting and observant. Bella, our first person, is about as interesting as a rock. <br><br>Isabella is nothing more than a Mary Sue. It doesn’t even take a genius to figure out that ‘Bella’ is Italian for ‘beautiful’. And her last name is ‘Swan’, which as a device in literature, symbolizes grace and beauty. Bella Swan? Beautiful Swan? Not very clever.<br><br>Here’s the contradiction: She’s ordinary. At least that’s what she keeps on insisting throughout the book. Practically everyone in her new school asks her to the dance, or to the prom. And she gets the guy who apparently “doesn’t date” because “none of the girls… are good-looking enough for him.” Her appearance is somewhat similar to the author’s, as well as her story of moving to a new place. If it helps, she’s a klutz – a last ditching effort to not make her a complete Mary Sue.<br><br>Most readers who like Twilight relate to Bella. Well I don’t. I can’t possibly relate with a young woman with no plans, no goals, no solid interests, no personality, no deep observations of life, no nothing - but is just “unconditionally and irrevocably in love with” her boyfriend. I really can’t. There’s something so shallow and pathetic about it; the way she’s willing to throw away her friends and family for a guy she has been acquainted with for just… two weeks? Besides, she is extremely boring, the sort which makes you fall asleep while she talks. And if she’s not obsessing over Edward, she does, well, nothing but whines, or tells him and his family that she doesn’t want to be rescued.<br><br>I would have liked it if Meyer had given her a little backbone and some brain cells, so she can get out of the stupid situations she puts her stupid self in. I don’t buy her “I grew up in Phoenix” statement. Nobody who grew up in Phoenix would be an idiot enough to wander around empty streets of an unfamiliar city alone. Then again, her idiocy is necessary to give way to her savior, Edward Cullen.<br><br>Edward is a vampire – oops! – a perfect vampire. He’s the most beautiful thing which ever existed… Have I mentioned that he’s perfect? And that he has topaz eyes? <br><br>He’s also bipolar. He’s serious one time, and then laughs exuberantly another. Insane mood swings, I tell you. He’s supposed to be your perfect male protagonist – hawt!!! (not hot; it should be hawt and must always be followed by three exclamation points), dangerous, smart, mysterious, perfect, and, uhm, sparkly (although the last adjective is not really required; it’s just a bonus if you’re lucky enough). He has this stalker-ish behavior, which is sick: He sneaks into Bella’s room and watches her sleep before they even get to talk. Some think that it’s romantic, but it’s just creepy. I don’t understand what’s so romantic about it. <br><br>Edward is 100-something years old and lives with his vampire family. Apparently he and his family don’t drink human blood, because they don’t want to be completely evil. They’re vegetarians: They only drink blood of animals. They are basically good vampires - who play baseball in the woods. (Ha! Who told you it’s boring to be a vampire? You’re allowed to play baseball!) And every myth about vampire is WRONG! Stakes, garlic, sleeping in coffin (although the idea of not sleeping ever was okay) – even sunlight!<br><br>But you know, age and race don’t matter in this book, because Edward and Bella actually fall in love! As for the reason… what is the reason again? Oh, because Bella smells good and Edward is hawt!!!. They’re made for each other! It’s destiny! <br><br>Seriously: The romance between them is forced and trite. And it’s even more boring than they both are, because they have no personality whatsoever. Geez, what am I saying? There’s no romance at all. There is no development of feelings. Just… BAM! They’re in love! They don’t even do anything but talk about how in love they are. From there, everything becomes sheer selfishness, and for the nth time, stupidity. Bella’s life revolves around her boyfriend, and nothing more. Not only is it absurd; it also gives horrible messages, namely:<br><br>1. It’s okay to fall in love in a matter of days and then risk your life for it.<br>2. You don’t have to have dreams or goals or anything like that; just get a girl/boyfriend. It’s far more important!<br>3. It’s perfectly fine to lie to your parents especially when it concerns your girl/boyfriend.<br>4. Ditch your friends. Girl/Boyfriend first, I tell you! Girl/Boyfriend first!<br><br>Considering the fact that Edward is so much older than Bella, shouldn’t he be more rational? Shouldn’t he be the mature one? Knowing he can kill Bella, he should have just left her alone. And how come Edward just blabbers everything to Bella? You know, the vampire stuff? For someone who has been in this world for more than a hundred years, he sure displays the maturity of a fetus.<br><br>And he’s supposed to be dangerous. That could have worked, if only Bella had the wits to be actually scared. It’s funny; that girl’s so brainless you can’t possibly scare her! As for Edward, it would have been better if he had shown how dangerous he could be. Then again, he is a good vampire, and he doesn’t want to become a monster. So he can only talk about it when it would be cooler for him to show it. <br><br>Oh, how could I forget! Edward SPARKLES UNDER THE SUN! Did you know that? Isn’t that cool? The coolest thing ever?! It’s like the very magnificent thing next to Edward! Sparkly sparkles! He sparkles, man, he sparkles “like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface” of his skin! Sparkling! Glittering! Glistening! Scintillating! Oh! my! gosh! Meyer is so original! Who else could have thought that?!<br><br>The plot is absolutely zero (the romance between Bella and Edward is not a plot). It’s basically just “He’s a vampire, she’s not. They fall in love. End of story.” And there were a lot of loopholes:<br><br>1. Why would the Cullens want to study in high school?! This is my number one question. Hello? Are they nuts? Can someone answer this for me?<br>2. Why would they want to blend in with the rest of humanity?<br>3. Why would they put themselves near humans when they know it’s hard to resist biting them?<br>4. Why would one bad vampire like to bite Bella specifically?<br><br>I’d like to answer and expand on loophole 4, because it’s absolutely preposterous. I didn’t even care about that James-vampire when he appeared, because his arrival was so cliched and so late. It’s like Meyer suddenly remembered that there should be something climax-y in Twilight, just to give it a semblance of a plot. This James ought to do the trick. He should be the one to threaten Bella’s life and then she makes an insanely silly mistake and she almost gets killed BUT Edward rescues her!<br><br>Meyer’s writing style isn’t something to commend on either; she writes like a twelve-year old. She makes Dan Brown look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. Her words are stilted. The narration is unexciting, dragging, and redundant. Bella keeps telling the readers how much she hates the rain in the first 100 pages of the book, and how she can’t dance If not that, she repetitively says how perfect and beautiful Edward is. What’s ironic is that despite all the perfect descriptions of him, I never quite pictured him in my mind. I’m still wondering how the rest of humanity can drool and squeal at the thought of him.<br><br>Bella glares all the time, too. Bella also grimaces a lot, and hisses, and stumbles. Glares, grimaces, hisses, stumbles. Four redundant freakin’ verbs in a 500-page book. That’s not so much, unless you can count only to three. <br><br>Meanwhile, Edward always smiles his crooked smile, and he dazzles people (especially Bella).<br><br>Nobody ‘said’ anything. Characters only ‘gasped’, ‘chuckled’, ‘questioned’, and ‘answered’. <br><br>Meyer also occasionally uses ridiculously long AND obscure words, which don’t quite fit since the rest of her words are plain and simple. I remember one: Ostentatious. She could have simply used ‘showy’ or ‘flamboyant’, but it just had to be ostentatious. Why she used that, I’ve no idea. (In the next books, Meyer uses bigger words. I wonder how big they are…)<br><br>And you know, Meyer ends Twilight with Bella attending the PROM. That’s how a vampire story should end: The heroine should attend the prom with her vampire boyfriend. In that ruffled gown and stiletto heels… It just makes sense (although it did take Bella about ten years to figure out Edward is taking her to the prom. What an idiot). Meyer skipped the almost action-y part (Emmett and Jasper’s dealing with James) but she elaborates on the prom.<br><br>Now that I’ve finished reading and dissecting Twilight, I still don’t understand all the hype it’s getting. It reads like a bad fan fic. I won't stop you from reading it, though. That's a choice for you to make.</span>

  <span id="freeText617235249836163667" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">On April 28, 1945, Italian resistance fighters cornered Benito Mussolini and shot both him and his mistress. Then they hoisted his body up on a meat hook and hung him upside down at a petrol station in Milan, just to prove that <em>yes</em>, that bastard is dead, and we capped him. We capped him good and proper.<br><br>However, the hype over a fascist dictator who held his own people hostage and fought (in a limp-dicked way) with the Axis Powers died out gradually over the twentieth century. Isn't it amazing how <em>Twilight</em>, a book whose whole plot consists of nothing more (no, <em>nothing</em> more) than a boring girl falling in lust with a glitterball, is on the tip of the western world's tongue, plastered all over the front window of Blockbuster and fuelling lunchtime conversations everywhere, while it stands as a given that you can walk into pretty much any high school and ask students who Benito Mussolini is, and the majority will space out and ask you if it's a band?<br><br>Take a look back at that first paragraph. Isn't a real-life account of someone as influential as Benito Mussolini infinitely more interesting and important than this godawful waste of precious trees?<br><br>I am part of today's youth, and yet I will never truly understand them.<br><br>So: <em>Twilight</em>. Yes, I'm finally reviewing it. I resisted for a long time, but I couldn't help myself. I have to do it. <br><br>The other day Josh and I were having a conversation about <em>Twilight</em>. Incidentally, Josh was trying to convince me that a boy sneaking into a girl's room to secretly watch her sleep with the bug-eye was cute. Josh is also a person who proclaimed that all Muslims want to destroy the world and that witch-burnings were perfectly okay.<br><br>I turned to Taylor and asked her what she thought. She said that she liked <em>Twilight</em>, but she knew it wasn't a masterpiece and that Bella was stupid. She went on to say that she didn't know what I meant when I stated that it is a horrendously anti-feminist book, and after heckling the thing to death with only a warning for talking during class to show for it, I gave up and talked about boyfriends with her instead.<br><br>I adore Taylor. She is a wonderful friend to me. This is why I don't chastise her for liking <em>Twishite</em> but worry for her instead.<br><br>We all know what the book is about. The book is about a Mary-Sue who latches on to a hot boy because he is hot and thereafter allows her whole world to revolve around him. She has no hobbies, interests, ambitions or future goals. She looks down on girls who appreciate shopping and physical intimacy, as well as women who cannot have children. She worships beauty as if it is sex. She follows Edward around like a lost puppy because he is the only thing she gives a shit about in the world even though they met each other eight seconds ago and have shared a handful of hormonal glances across a biology classroom.<br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681101.jpg" class="escapedImg"><br><br>The all-consuming relationship between Bella and Edward is not the kind of relationship anyone should aspire to. Edward is physically forceful toward Bella, and though she spends every waking moment making out with the ground he walks on he still shits on her from a great height. <br><br>"Foolish female/human! I is man, I is doing right thing, you must follow!"<br><br>The caveman/cavewoman mentality between both parties is absolutely painful. As painful as the throb of purple prose encased between these heinously far-apart covers, and the dreadful fragments and inconsistent style of Meyer's writing.<br><br>It's ludicrous, really. This book is not a book. It is a really, really long Facebook status. It's a little gimmick that's gotten out of hand. <br><br>Who remembers the absolutely awful "Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" fad? That's kind of what <em>Twilight</em> is like. A really fucked-up piece of sexist rubbish that spiraled into a phenomenon when really it belongs in the garbage can where no one will ever look at it ever again, ever.<br><br>Maybe that's slightly harsh. Or maybe not? Maybe we shouldn't condone something that <s>forced chameleon authors to churn out</s> <em>inspired</em> books like <em>Hush, Hush</em>, <em>Fallen</em>, and <em>Halo</em> - books that glorify unhealthy relationships and portray women as weak, helpless, pathetic monkeys. It also pushed authors like Kristen Cashore to try to be different by creating horrible, selfish protagonists that are stereotypical caricatures of feminists and that verge on advocating misandry. <br><br>But hey, who cares, right? As long as teens are reading!<br><br>No. I'd rather read the back of a cereal box than this book. I'd rather read the ingredients of my shampoo than slog through this again. It would be far less offensive and morally damaging, not to mention infuriating. I believe I aged ten years during my first failed attempt at wading through the <em>Twilight</em> quicksand.<br><br>Never mind the fact that the whole idea is stolen from L.J. Smith's dreadful <em>Vampire Diaries</em> series, that everyone crooned was a <em>Twilight</em> rip-off until they looked at the release date and realized it came to fruition in the nineties. Busted, Meyer! Hot damn!<br><br>Ms. Meyer's attitude towards her fans is interesting, too. I find it strange that she has so many worshippers, considering that she behaves as though these young impressionable preteens don't deserve her (regardless of the fact that she is catering to them and that they are the reason she has a career in the first place). I am, of course, referring to the whole <em>Midnight Sun</em> incident in which she disappointed legions of reliable and faithful readers by throwing an angsty bitch-fit and proclaiming that she "didn't feel alone with her manuscript any more" and couldn't finish it. How sad it is that no more blood could possibly be squeezed from the <em>Twilight</em> rock! <br><br>I could go into characterization, but what would be the point? There is none. Bella is a wish-fulfillment device. Edward is a psychopath who somehow manages to be boring. The Cullens are all dull, preppy, self-righteous cures for insomnia. The villain...what villain?<br><br>Oh, yeah. James? Non-event. No point, no motivation. Only there because Meyer got caught up her her plotless fluff and then suddenly thought "Shit! I forgot that something has to happen!" so quickly inserted some watery excuse for a bad guy and a shaky climax that of course ended in more drama between the power couple. <br><br>Another issue with the anti-feminism of this book: of course, one of the main and most twisted villains would have to be a sexually-active and liberated woman. Of course, a woman who is free and decides what she wants to do with her life would have to be evil. How dare she not answer to her man and behave like a loyal dog? Fie!<br><br>And what a shitty prom they had, eh? Damn! It was the same with <em>Halo</em>. Columns of shimmering moonlight and posh boys in tuxes. At my prom, I wore satin pants and sneakers, and two sassy guys won Best Couple. I am not shitting you. <em>That</em> is an epic prom, people. A prom with Gaga karaoke, Jello balls and genderless washrooms. <br><br>Canadians can damn well <em>party</em>. Yuh-huh.<br><br><strong>Anyway!</strong><br><br>There are so many parodies of this book that I'm amazed anyone takes it seriously. A legit movie, <em>Vampires Suck</em>, outwardly rips the crap out of <em>Twilight</em>, and makes money doing so. If that's not an epic win, I don't know what is. Not to mention Stephen King's little quip about Stephenie's inability to write anything that isn't crap, that made waves among the <em>Twilight</em> fanbase and was rebuffed with thousands of tweeny screams of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb72V_4N5ko&amp;NR=1" rel="nofollow">"YER JEST JELUS!"</a><br><br>We also have the fan rips, like countless demotivational posters, deviantART's constant stream of joke memes and comics, and all sort of hilarious Edward/Jacob slash fanfiction.<br><br>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0igSirIVe1Q&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">There's also this.</a>)<br><br><strong>Note</strong>: Before the movies came out, I was a loyal fan of the indie/rock band Muse. They were fun and different. When <em>Twilight</em> hit the big screen, Muse sold themselves out and became a been-there-done-that pseudo-pop band who catered to the masses and left their old fans high and dry. That is the power of corporate America, people.<br><br>I could go on to review the rest of the series, but why would I bother? Why would I want to dredge up old memories of pedophilia and blood in a Slurpie cup and constant, insufferable cheese? <br><br>Frankly, I would rather stand in an elevator with Mussolini than Meyer. At least we would have something to talk about.<br><br><strong>To conclude</strong>: This book will go down in history as one of media's great mistakes. Kids of the thirtieth century will look back on us and the hoards of screaming thirteen-year-olds worshipping the 'love' between a creepy old man and his sullen lap-dog and laugh. Hard.<br><br><br><br><strong>BONUS TIME!</strong><br><br>...because <em>Twilight</em> without Bonus Time would be cat shit without a litter box.<br><br><br><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841r/681102.jpg?141545886733667" class="escapedImg hostedImg" data-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841r/681102.jpg" style=";display:none;" data-error="[image error]" onerror="$j(this).loadHostedImage();" onload="$j(this).loadHostedImage();"><img src="/assets/loading-trans.gif" class="escapedImg loadingImg"></span>

There are quite a few things that bother me about this book, I will only list the top 5 here:<br><br>1) Bella - She is the exact character that I do NOT want my daughters to have as a role model.  She is a sighing, swooning, fainting, weeping, weak female character straight out of the 19 century.  This is the 21st century people!

She is a sighing, swooning, fainting, weeping, weak female character straight out of the 19 century.  This is the 21st century people!  Do we want to raise a generation of namby pamby young women who can't stand on their own two feet?<br><br>2) Edward - This is the kind of guy that I warn my daughters to stay away from.  The guy sneaks into her room and watches her sleep.  Does anyone else see anything creepy about this?  He's obsessed with rescuing her and he thinks that if he doesn't follow her around 24/7 that she'll get herself into a dangerous situation that she can't handle.  Does anyone else see anything creepy about this?<br><br>3) The relationship - This is a textbook case of co-dependency if I ever saw one.  They hardly know each other, but suddenly they can't live without each other?  The dialogue is like something straight out of a Harlequin - ugh!  I think that young people have enough trouble knowing the difference between love and lust and this book does not help.<br><br>4) Too much emphasis on appearances - It's like Edward's good looks are all that matters, personality is not important.  Bella must be good looking too, why else would a 100 year old vampire be interested in a 17 year old girl?  Her personality leaves much to be desired so we know it's not that.<br><br>5) The comparison between this series and the Harry Potter series - If I were J.K. Rowling I would be offended that people are comparing the Twilight series with the Harry Potter series.  Stephani Meyer's writing is NOT up to par with J.K. Rowling - not even close.<br><br>The worst thing about this book is that it's so hugely popular.  There are thousands of young girls all over the nation who are swooning over Edward and wishing that they could be "just like Bella" - gag!  I truly think that this book is a detriment to society.  There's a lot more I could say, but I think that I've offended enough people for now.</span>

I've read books that I wish were paper so that I could fling it across the room during a fit of rage. <br><br>I've read books with alpha-douches who have made me use curse words that have made a Navy sailor blush. I've read books where the love interest is as abusive asshole who would think nothing of commenting on his love interest's tits or weight. And these books aren't even new adult. <br><br>I've read books where the main character is a rampant fellow-girl hater and slut shamer. I've read books where the main character is so fucking dumb it makes my teeth hurts. I've read books where the main character seems to be doing her damnedest to remove herself from the human gene pool and it is only by the grace of <em>deus ex</em> fucking <em>machina</em> that she is saved. <br><br>I've read books whose plot makes <em>Game of Thrones</em> seem simple, and not in the <strong>"Wow, that's really complex"</strong> kind of way as it is <strong>"What the actual <em>fuck</em> were you smoking when you wrote this?"</strong> kind of way. <br><br>So in that sense, <em>Twilight</em> is really not that bad. Sure, Bella is dumb and a Mary Sue, but the worst you can say about her is that she is completely colorless and bland, with the personality of a block of tofu. The worst you can say about Edward is that he's a weirdo stalker who likes really young girls despite his age, but man, watching a girl while she sleeps? He's been out-creeped by far worse men. <br><br>So really. I mean it. You may hate <em>Twilight</em> with my blessing, but please don't believe it's the worst example of YA literature out there. Is isn't, by any stretch of the imagination. </span>

I don't know now. You know those books that are just so horrible that you want to go on and on about how horrible they were, but you don't want to waste your precious time doing it? I'm in that situation. To review, or not to review? *tick tock tick tock* <br><br>Oh, <em>damn it</em>. Fine! Well, it has been quite a long time since I read this book, but the dreadful memory of it plagues my mind. <br><br>The writing is utterly atrocious. The first few sentences of this book are about the weather and Bella's favorite shirt. "It was 85 degrees (I think), and I was wearing my favorite shirt, with lace and all that crap." Okay, she doesn't say the last four words in that quote, but it suits her, right? Oh, and it gets worse. "Edward's voice was velvety." How can a voice be velvety? I thought velvet was a type of cloth? It could be as soft as velvet. Not velvety itself. Perhaps I'm wrong. I just want to believe I'm right, okay? Then she'd talk about how utterly <em>fruity</em> Edward's chest smelled. <br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380222758/282327.gif" width="220" height="220" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br>Fruity...? What, does he rub his body with kiwis, grapes, oranges, and bananas every morning?<br><br>Sometimes there were pages of just description! Too much description kills your writing. Meyer doesn't seem to grasp that at all. <br><br>And the adjectives! Meyer just <em>needs</em> an adjective for every single noun she has in her book. <br><br><em>"Now, more than ever, I yearned for his carefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage and his warm hand around my cold fingers."</em><br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681085.gif" width="240" height="240" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br><br>Meyer also believes that using long, seemingly complicated words in her sentences makes her writing more "sophisticated." She doesn't even use them in the right context! The more a writer tends to use long, unnecessary words, the more of a truly bad writer I think they are. Their writing seems forced. <br><br><br>Twilight does not have characters. It has robots. Bella is an emotionless twit. Edward can't read her thoughts because she DOESN'T HAVE ANY. Simple. All she does is whine, whine, and whine! She whines about the weather, friends, her father, Jacob, etc. Is there anything that pleases her? Besides the fruity smell of Edward's chest, what pleases her? She is almost depressed throughout the book. If Edward isn't in her life, then it's hell. Pure hell. She can't function properly. She has nightmares. Bella is the type of character that would just sit there in the middle of a bloody hurricane and wait for Edward to come rescue her instead of getting off her butt and saving herself. If he's not in her life, then screw everything. Plus, she's very pessimistic. Everything displeases her. <br><br><em>"Oh, rain. There goes my good day." <br><br>"I hate anything that's wet."</em> <br><br>So I suppose you don't like slurpies? Or showers, Bella? That explains why your hair smells like strawberries. Instead of eating them like a normal human being, you rub them all over your hair.<br><br>Edward is a disgusting, abusive, creepy little moron. I loath him. What kind of vampire sparkles and is on a bunny diet? That's not a vampire! He's an abomination! How dare Meyer makes one of my favorite fictional, monsters sparkle! Oh, geez. I can't.<br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681086.jpg" width="350" height="400" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br><strong>Voldemort: But quite a nice observation there, Severus. A trillion points for Slytherin!</strong><br><br>He also watches Bella sleep at night, claiming it is fascinating. Yes, to Edward, watching a girl sleep at night is the most interesting thing he's ever done in his life of, what, 100 and something years. He could be doing so many things with his long vampire life. Traveling, making  friends. Instead he watches girls sleep. Of course Bella doesn't mind that. <br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681087.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br><br>Edward controls and abuses Bella. Just read the damn book if you need examples. He is older than her dead grandfather. He doesn't have any friends. He's straight up from Planet Loser. What do they see in each other? Even Robert thinks he's weak, damn it! Just read this!<br><br>Well, this is regarding <em>Breaking Dawn</em>. Whatever. I don't care! I just needed this to prove that even the guy who plays Edward hates him. <br><br><em>“My wife is dying, I have completely f-cked up my life and hers, and Jacob’s like [To Bella] ‘Hey, baby, you don’t look too bad to me.' And I’m just sitting there, like, with a bucket collecting [Bella’s] vomit. That really wouldn’t happen. I should have thrown the vomit at him.”</em><br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681088.gif" width="300" height="200" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681089.gif" width="300" height="200" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br><br>Bamn! <em>I win.</em> I actually like Robert Pattinson. I think he's very genuine and funny. He was actually glad Twilight was over. I have respect for him. But the character he plays? Oh, Lordy. I hope Robert moves on to play awesome characters.<br><br>Oh, and Jacob... I don't know how to phrase this. He's a disgrace to every single fictional creature out there. Edward is as well. Worry not! However, Jacob is just something else. He's like the guy version of Bella. He's just as pessimistic as her and just as idiotic. He falls in love with Bella at first. Obsesses over her. Then as he finds out she will NEVER choose him, he falls for her monster of a daughter! Is this real? Of course it's not but is it?! I'm shocked. And he's not a werewolf if he's bloody shirtless all the time. Remus Lupin is a classy werewolf! <br><br>The plot wasn't really a plot. What the heck was the whole point!? From my understanding, the whole plot was: Bella and Edward meet. Some dude wants Bella because her blood smells like strawberries. Edward kills him. The evil dude's girlfriend wants revenge. Edward kills her too. And somewhere in between this group called the "Volturi" wants to kill Edward because of God-knows-what. Oh, and all the antagonists die in the end. Happily ever after. Yay! FAIL! Utter fail. It's a truly cliche ending. <br><br><em>"And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever."</em><br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681090.gif" width="370" height="230" alt="description" class="escapedImg"><br><br>What is a the message? I think there is more than one message. 100-and-whatever-year-old "vampires" that go to high school and fall in love with seventeen-year-old girls are in. Vampires get all glittery in the sunlight. Try to kill yourself so you can hear your boyfriend's voice in your head. Go for the young daughter if the mother isn't willing to love you. <br><br>I could go on and on, but I want to go eat. Chocolate. Tons of it.<br><br>Anyway, the only reason I would use this book is for me to lose weight. I would exercise my arms with it. It's awfully heavy. So that's one benefit. I'm actually GLAD I read this book. I wouldn't know what horrible writing was if I didn't read this book. I could avoid everything that happened in this book. I can learn from Meyer's mistakes. See? <br><br>Have a good day, Lovers of Literature.  </span>

I'm serious. </blockquote>Besides, nothing in the universe can ever compete with this <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/153418855">very thoughtful review by Bird Brian</a>.<br><br>Anyway, how about the story of my relationship with Twilight, this <strong>Twinkie¹</strong> of literature? <br><blockquote>¹ Twinkie, because it's addictive to many and yet lacks any kind of substance/nutritional value besides empty calories. You watch, when the world is destroyed in nuclear explosion, cockroaches and Twinkies will be what's left on this planet. <br><br><em>Also, I think I may have borrowed this comparison from the one and only <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/519292.Cleolinda_Jones" title="Cleolinda Jones">Cleolinda Jones</a></em>.</blockquote>Once upon a time, 5-6 years ago, I was sick with the nastiest flu and therefore was lying in bed browsing the Interwebs in the state of cough-syrup-induced befuzzlement, when somehow, via a combination of inexplicable links I came across <strong>the site that popped my Twilight cherry with the best parodies that I have yet come across</strong>:<br><br>Enter <a href="http://cleolinda.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">
  <strong>Cleolinda Jones</strong>
</a>, whose incredulous snark of Twilight recaps made me the happiest person on this planet for a while:<blockquote>Introducing the <a href="http://cleoland.pbworks.com/w/page/10373763/Twilight#Bookdiscussionentries" rel="nofollow">immortal recaps of Stephenie Meyer's wish-fulfillment creations</a>, featuring 'fursploding', 'sparklepires', and this brilliant wrap-up of the series:<br><br><em>"And they sexed happily ever after in their magic cottage while their half-vampire toddler slept in the next room, and it was the best series starting with a teenage girl in love with a mysterious boy in her class that ended up with a teenage girl defending her growth-accelerated mutant hybrid baby from an ancient clan of evil vampires with her magical psychic shield that I ever read, THE END."</em>
</blockquote>Cleolinda did not stop here, however. She did watch all four Twilight movies and <em>- bless her selfless heart -</em> treated us to her trademark <em>
  <strong>Movies in Fifteen Minutes</strong>
</em> parodies of them, which, dear reader, you can find here:<blockquote>
<a href="http://m15m.livejournal.com/19551.html" rel="nofollow">Twilight in Fifteen Minutes</a><br><a href="http://m15m.livejournal.com/21825.html" rel="nofollow">New Moon in Fifteen Minutes</a><br><a href="http://m15m.livejournal.com/22620.html" rel="nofollow">Eclipse in Fifteen Minutes</a><br>And, finally, <a href="http://m15m.livejournal.com/22931.html" rel="nofollow">Breaking Dawn in Fifteen Minutes (Part One)</a>
</blockquote>-------------<br>Meanwhile, there was <strong>Dana</strong> who was appalled by the lack of respect for basic grammar (not to mention decent storytelling) that Twilight books showed. And therefore she created... wait for it... wait for it...<blockquote>The best Tumblr ever - <a href="http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Reasoning with Vampires</a>
</blockquote>I owe so much of my grammar refreshers to Dana's keen eye and never-ending patience. And, just for a taste of it, I hope I'm allowed to share my all-time favorite from this Tumblr <em>(which I will take down immediately if there is any problem)</em>:<br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681093.jpg" width="400" class="escapedImg"><br>--------------------<br>While Dana was hard at work correcting the grammar and awful writing of Twilight, <strong>the guys over at <a href="www.rifftrax.com" rel="nofollow">Rifftrax.com</a></strong> (formerly of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000" rel="nofollow">MST-3000 fame</a>) were busy creating the parody mp3 tracks, that when played over the Twilight movies finally achieve the goal of turning those into hilarious, although not always PG-13, films.<blockquote>Among other creations of pure comedic genius, they brought us their version of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE0fknMFFXg" rel="nofollow"><s>in</s>famous Edward's lullaby, which you can see here on YouTube</a>, complete with the following immortal lyrics:<br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681094.jpg" width="350" class="escapedImg"><br><br><em>"I want to chomp into your throoooooat.<br>And watch you bleed out on the floooooor.<br>Then I'll bathe myself in your life essence<br>as you die.<br>Tear your heart out of your chest <br>and crack the bones <br>and suck the marrow out. <br>Slice into your brain for sandwiches <br>and maybe have an omelette made of--"</em>
</blockquote>---------------<br>It was only a matter of time until <strong>Mark Oshiro</strong> of <em>'Mark Reads...'</em> fame decided to put himself through hours of horrified suffering, documented over here, at <a href="http://markreads.net/reviews/2010/11/complete-mark-reads-twilight-archive/" rel="nofollow">Mark Reads Twilight</a>.<br>-----------------<br>On the other side of the Interwebs, <strong>Dan Bergstein</strong> of SparkLife decided that his time would be best spent <a href="http://community.sparknotes.com/2009/07/16/blogging-twilight-index-page" rel="nofollow">'Blogging Twilight'</a>. I will not give much away by stating Dan's version of Bella's daughter's name <em>(which can kick the original name's behind while hopping on the left foot with both hands tied behind its back)</em>: <strong>OPTIMUS BEYONCE!</strong> <em>(Take that, Renesmee!)</em><br><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681095.jpg" width="195" class="escapedImg">*<img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681096.jpg" width="195" class="escapedImg"><br><em>The lovely original artwork is included with the recaps, by the way.</em><br>--------------<br>And finally, I have to pay my dues to the lovely and spot-on video parodies by <strong>Nathaniel Jones</strong> - complete with a breathtakingly funny voiceover narration that EVERYONE (and I mean it!) has to experience at least once in life:<blockquote>
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41OixAKZQWQ" rel="nofollow">Twilight: The Broodening</a>
  <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LcB_Z9lf5g" rel="nofollow">Twilight 2: Broodening Harder</a>
  <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsA8lNGD2eg" rel="nofollow">Twilight: The Broodening 3 - Electric Broodaloo</a>
</blockquote>----------------<br><br>Anyway, dear friends, we have almost survived the years of Twilight epidemic. Now it's just Twilight fanfics left to darken our days. But that, too, shall pass. Right? Right?</span>

  <span id="freeText14386467779082315951" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">I got so tired of receiving Twilight questions on the Never-Ending Quiz that I went out and bought a copy. It's about as good as I had expected, but I have already managed to answer a few questions correctly.<br><br>An anecdote which I at least found amusing. Shortly after buying it, I was invited to an eighteenth birthday party (our next door neighbor's daughter). I had the following conversation with Cate:<br><br>"So I suppose you read the Twilight books?"<br><br>"No, what are they?"<br><br>"You know, those vampire books. I just bought the first one."<br><br>"Oh... right. Can I borrow it when you're finished?"<br><br>She wasn't just teasing me... when I left, she checked to make sure I remembered. So somehow I've ended up supplying Stephenie Meyer to 18 year old girls. How did that happen?<br><br>****************<br><br>OK, now I've finished it. I still don't understand why this is apparently the greatest publishing phenomenon of the post-Potter world. Here are a few hypotheses:<br><br>Sex. Don't underestimate sex, everyone knows it sells books. And there are some pretty steamy, graphic descriptions of kissing and snuggling, which could conceivably get a suggestible pre-teen all hot and bothered. I'm not a suggestible pre-teen, so it's a little difficult to judge.<br><br>Style. Often more important than people realise. It's a first-person narrative, and yes, it does read as though it had been written by a shy, bookish, 17 year old girl, whose main literary output to date had been essays about Macbeth and Jane Eyre for her English class. You can positively hear her congratulating herself every time she uses a polysyllabic word. (Well done, Manny, "polysyllabic" is bound to net me an extra point!) So I guess this says something about the author's skill, or helps teen readers identify with the heroine?<br><br>Paedophilia. You're constantly reading about all those creepy paedophiles who lurk in chatrooms, pretending to be teenagers and trying to groom unsuspecting victims. This is, formally, a romance between a 17-year old female virgin and a centenarian. You can see how useful it would be. "I just love Twilight! It doesn't bother me at all that he's so much older than her! I think he loves her just as much as she loves him!" Excuse me while I throw up, I got too far into character there for a moment.<br><br>Unfortunately, none of these explanations really convince me. I must find someone to ask! Well, having now finished the book, I'm going to lend it to Cate across the road - in fact, she and her parents are coming to dinner this evening. But I think Cate will be as mystified as I am. How about my goddaughter Sophie, who's only 12? My first thought is that she'll find it too unsophisticated, but perhaps I'm overestimating her. Stay tuned for further updates.<br><br>****************<br><br>Those further updates I promised. It's only a sample of two, and I would love more data, but so far I am not convinced that all young womanhood in the Western world is infected with the deadly Meyer mind-virus.<br><br>As I said, I lent the book to Cate-across-the-road (just turned 18, cute, party animal). I was indeed a little apprehensive when she asked to borrow my copy. But when I saw her today and asked for an opinion, it rapidly become clear that she hadn't even looked at it - she has better things to do than read this trash. She was relieved when I made it clear that I was the opposite of offended.<br><br>I also polled my goddaughter Sophie (almost 13, smart, voracious reader, into chess and any kind of sport). When I dropped by for our usual Sunday morning chess session, I asked her if she had read Twilight. There was a brief moment of mildly embarrassed silence, which I interpreted as: why is he asking me such a dumb question, that's not like him? Then she shrugged and said no, she hadn't, and we went back to looking at the Slav Defense.<br><br>It would be reassuring to hear more stories like these, though...<br><br>****************<br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/trivia/details/32186" target="_blank">http://www.goodreads.com/trivia/detai...</a><br><br>I couldn't resist the temptation to post this question on the Quiz. So far no one has flamed me, but it's early days yet. <br><br>Come on, Twilight fans, you afraid of a fight?<br><br>****************<br><br>I hardly got flamed at all. Damn! Sorry, Twilight fans, you are as insipid as your heroine. <br><br>****************<br><br>Another update. Oh dear. Cate finally gave back the copy that she'd borrowed several months ago. I'm afraid to say that she's not merely <em>read</em> it, she <em>loved</em> it. Now she's going to read the whole series. What have I done?<br><br>Not only that, Sophie saw the movie and thought it was "great". I was doing my best not to succumb to hysteria before I'd had a chance to evaluate the facts for myself, but now I'm starting to feel seriously concerned. Maybe the Meyer mind-virus really does exist. <br><br><br></span>

  <span id="freeText5310494560492865628" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">Reviewed for <a href="http://www.thcreviews.com" rel="nofollow">THC Reviews</a><br>I have to admit that I haven't read a great deal of young adult literature during my adult life, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect from <em>Twilight</em>. There was also a great deal of hype surrounding this book, which can sometimes mean a really great book and other times can be a big letdown. Now that I have finally read <em>Twilight</em>, I have to say that it definitely lived up to the hype for me. I absolutely loved this tale of teen love between a human and a vampire. With this type of subject matter the story could have been completely campy, but instead was very beautiful, in my opinion, with enough romance and substance to rival the best adult romance novels. In fact, I thought that Twilight exhibited a surprising depth of emotion, intimacy and even sensuality without ever resorting to anything explicit. I think the intimacy was owing in large part to the amazing level of communication between Bella and Edward. These two teen protagonists affected more stark honesty in their communication than many adult characters in romance novels, rarely holding anything back from each other. Edward was even forthcoming about who and what he was far sooner than I ever expected him to be. The sensuality was conveyed through simple things like smiles, kisses and touches and most importantly their beautiful dialog. Of course much of this was possible because, neither Edward nor Bella, were really “normal” teenagers. I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed the book nearly as much as I did if the main teen characters had behaved in what has seemed to become the “typical” teen manner of extreme cattiness, rebellion,  and out-of-control hormones. Instead, the story became a refreshing take on teen behavior, and a gentle reminder that not all teens do behave in the “typical” way.<br><br>I honestly can't think of a single thing that's not to like about the two main characters, Edward and Bella. Edward is a kind, sensitive and loving beta hero with a dash of alpha protectiveness (he probably wouldn't be a very good vampire without that). He wages a constant battle in his own mind between the knowledge that Bella is perfect for him and the knowledge that being near him will only increase the risks for his adorable but accident-prone danger-magnet. Edward is frequently reminding Bella of the risk he himself poses to her very life, and yet he always behaves as a perfect gentleman, even in the most difficult circumstances. I also love the gentle way that Edward teases Bella, and sometimes she gives back in kind. I enjoyed this banter and thought that it gave a lightly humorous dimension to the story. In addition to having a good sense of humor, Bella was also very intelligent, shy and a bit socially awkward, and endearingly clumsy, making her entirely relatable to me. Bella considered herself to be a very plain, ordinary girl, but Edward thought her to be completely beautiful. Having played the role of parent in her relationship with both of her parents, one could say that Bella had not had the most ideal upbringing, but it did not stop her from being the best person she could be or loving her parents dearly. I think Bella's best trait though, was her intuitive nature about Edward and things in general. I love it when the heroine in romance novels can simply sense things about the hero and read into that accordingly. Bella did have one moment where I would predict that many adult readers would consider her TSTL (too-stupid-to-live), but I was able to forgive that lapse because of her youth and inexperience with such dangerous situations. Overall, both Edward and Bella were two engaging characters who sparkled (no pun intended, but you'll get it when you read the book) in nearly every scene that they shared. I greatly enjoyed reading them and thought that they complimented each other perfectly.<br><br>The secondary cast of characters was a wonderful dichotomous mix of both the human and the  supernatural. There were Bella's high school friends, who were generally a mix of pretty good kids, the type I wouldn't mind my own kids being friends with or would have liked being friends with myself in my teen years.  Edward's family was an eclectic mix of personalities. There was Emmet, the big, lovable lug of a teddy bear, mysterious and aloof Rosalie, Alice and Jasper with their amazing psychic and empathic gifts, and their “parents,” Carlisle (aka Dr. Cullen) and Esme who have their own fascinating back-stories. I also found the Native American father and son characters, Billy and Jacob Black to be intriguing. They seem to share some contentious history with the Cullens which isn't fully explored in this volume. It will be very interesting to see where this part of the story leads in future installments.<br><br><em>Twilight</em> is a very sweet and innocent romance, which I mentioned earlier has no explicit elements. There is no sex, only a couple of mild profanities, and considering that the subject matter deals with vampires, the violence is kept to a minimum. In my opinion, this book is quite appropriate for the age group for which it is intended. I would have no problem at all with my children reading it when they are a bit older. In fact, I felt as I read the book that it sends some positive family and relationship messages to teens. Even though Bella's relationship with her parents is less than ideal, there is still love and respect between them, and Edward seems to have very loving “family” connections as well. What I liked most though, is the development of Edward and Bella's romance. Their physiological attraction to each other is immediate and powerful, yet they take the time to build a friendship that is based on mutual trust, respect and love, which is more than can be said for many adults. Edward and Bella only discuss sex one time over the course of the novel and in very subtle terms, but in my opinion, Edward's blood lust could be taken as something of a metaphor for sexual desire. Whether taken in the metaphorical or mythological context, I thought that Edward's self-control contained a beautiful message of his pure love for Bella superseding all other desires.<br><br>I found <em>Twilight</em> to be a thoroughly enjoyable read which has earned a place on my keeper shelf. The first two-thirds of the book moves at a rather languid but steady pace owing to the extensive character and relationship development. After that, it almost instantly turns into a taut suspense/thriller when Bella's life is threatened. This is one of those books that was very difficult to put down. I just couldn't wait to see what might happen next or what new piece of the puzzle might be revealed, and Ms. Meyer also did not disappoint with her own unique take on vampire mythology. Even though the book is written entirely in first-person from Bella's perspective, I thought the author did a good job of conveying Edward's thoughts and feelings too, through extensive use of dialog. As an aside, I really liked the small-town atmosphere of Forks, but as a Phoenician, I couldn't help but have a soft spot for the scenes in Phoenix. As such, I can attest to all the place names being real and the descriptions of the city to be spot on, which isn't surprising since Ms. Meyer is a Phoenician as well. It was rather surreal but also pretty cool to read scenes that are set in places that I have actually been. <em>Twilight</em> is the first volume in the <em>Twilight Saga</em> followed by <em>
  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon" title="New Moon by Stephenie Meyer">New Moon</a>
</em>, <em>Eclipse</em>, and <em>
  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1162543.Breaking_Dawn" title="Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer">Breaking Dawn</a>
</em>. Ms. Meyer is also planning a re-write of Twilight from Edward's perspective titled <em>Midnight Sun</em>. I am really looking forward to continuing this fascinating series, and even though I am often disappointed with movie versions of my favorite novels, I am truly looking forward to the the <em>Twilight</em> movie which is due to be released in theaters this December.</span>

  <span id="freeText17642137011686944989" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">No problem, Liv. Oftentimes, people don't respond back, so it didn't bother me at all. <br><br>In my response to your original message, I wasn't really trying to debate whether the book was good or bad. I was trying to explain how two people can see the same thing in very different ways. <br><br>You obviously were greatly disturbed by the book, but nothing about it bothered me in any way. For me, it was a compelling and romantic story. Otherwise, I wouldn't have given it five stars.<br><br>You see Edward as creepy and stalkerish, but I viewed him as a near-perfect romantic hero. I related to him extremely well, and he'll always have a place on my list of literary crushes.<br><br>You see Bella as weak, and while I'll admit that there were times that she was a bit of doormat and I wished she would stand up for herself a little more, I still usually understood where she was coming from. I seem to recall that she had rather low self-esteem (which was not too surprising given her family life) and didn't see herself as anything special next to the perfection of Edward. I personally have struggled with confidence issues, so I felt I understood Bella's thoughts fairly well. You seem to be a pretty confident person, so maybe this type of mindset doesn't resonate with you in the same way.<br><br>Ultimately, there could be a multitude of reasons why we don't see the book the same way. I addressed some other possible reasons in my first response, not the least of which is that we probably have very different personalities and life experiences. Quite frequently, I run across this same issue of not seeing the same things in a story as other people did. Where I might read a book and find little to recommend it (and yes, occasionally things that might even disturb me), others love and adore it and don't seem bothered by it at all. Most of the time I just shrug, mentally say "OK, but I don't see it," and move on. It can certainly be annoying and even frustrating, but the reality is that two people can perform the same action (in this case, reading the same book) but because they are unique individuals, each one is going to experience it differently. As a student of psychology, I know that even people who agree with my viewpoint still took something different away from their reading, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's just one of the great mysteries of life.<br><br>BTW, Perks of Being a Wallflower is on my very looong TBR list. It's one of my daughter's favorites, so she got me interested in it a while back.</span>

I don't even know what made me "unconditionally and irrevocably in love" with it in the first place! But then again, I was a hopeless romantic trying to find love, and I thought Twilight would cheer me up for my lovesick... ness...<br><br>Unfortunately, I was WRONG. When I first read the book, I was addicted to it. I finished reading it for one day because it was "so good." Time passed by, and I was hoping that my tasteless friend would give me the second volume of the series because I wanted more... MORE I TELL YA!<br><br>As the time passed by, I realized the book was just stupid-fluff and very sexually frustrating. <br><br>First off, we meet with the main character, the female "heroine," Isabella Marie Swan. Or Bella for short. I realized now, she's nothing more than a Mary Sue. Her name is even like one as well! Bella is Italian for beautiful. Throw it with Swan. Beautiful Swan. What's even worse is that EVERY guy falls in love with her when she moves in with her lazy ass daddy who needs Bella to cook and clean for him. Typical anti-feminist, no? Her appearance is somewhat similar to the author, and her story when moving into a new place (see twilight FAQ's in her website). Oh yeah, and she gets the guy to top it all off. Typical Mary Sue.<br><br>Edward Cullen... is just too HAWT for this world! He's perfect, he's got perfect hair, perfect body, perfect face... hell, I wouldn't be surprised if he even has a perfect penis! D; Anyways, as the typical teenage fangirl I am, I fell in love with him too... I still am... but not as much. What made me head-over-heels for this guy is that he's charming and witty... but being about 100 years old is such a turn off. Not to mention, stalking Bella almost every night... and she doesn't care when she finds this out! That's just a weird/sick/creepy relationship.<br><br>What I don't get is the reason for those two loving each other. Stephanie Meyer makes it destined for them to be together... but exaclty what is the reason again...? Oh yeah! Cause Bella has sweet-smelling blood and Edward's HAWT. Duh. That's why they were made for each other! Except for the whole "no sex" thing... well from what I heard, they're gonna do it later on in some other volume of Twilight. It'll be just like another erotic Anita Blake failure.<br><br>Who I really hated second to Bella was Jacob Black. He was too annoying and pestered too much. Maybe he'll get better later on... I heard he and Bella hooked up. I had a feeling Bella was gonna do that anyways.<br><br>The almost 500 pages Bella narrates about in Twilight is how HAWT Edward is. She's obsessing way too much and then she declares that she would even risk her life to be with him! Dude, you knew him for like, a week. Now you decide to be emo for him? Two words: Get. Help.<br><br>All of a sudden, a group of villianous vampires come out of nowhere and terrorize the Cullens and Bella. The whole five chapters of that was a big blur. Was it even five chapters? I don't know anymore! x.x<br><br>Do not read this!!!! This is a warning to all bookworms out there! Don't say I never told you so!!!!</span>

We're going to try not to gawk terribly at some of the sentences that have rumpled our eyebrows so far. We're going to just forget that on p 12 the modern teenage narrator is said to have <em>donned</em> her jacket. We're going to just read the book, that's all.<br><br>--(Later)-- <br><br>--OK here's my review. --<br><br>If you come to this book looking for things to like, you will find things to like. Star-cross'd lovers, vampires, the universal awkwardness of high school: hay has been previously made from these topics, and that isn't likely to change in the future. In Twilight, I thought the new-kid-at-school stuff was handled well, and some of the back-and-forth of teenagers sussing each other out was great. The author also has a very dry sense of humor which popped up, but too seldom. <br><br>If, on the other hand, you come to this book looking for things to hate, you will find things to hate. The author makes a habit of using phrases that yank the reader out of character and out of world, and there are a number of instances where the information the reader is given contradicts or ignores what the author previously told us. This doesn't make Twilight a bad book, but it makes it a bit amateurish. The book felt like a NaNoWriMo project that was delivered to Barnes &amp; Noble on December 1st. And if that sounds like sour grapes, it is.<br><br>My main problem with the book was that language and behavior the author uses to characterize the relationship between Edward and Bella is the language and behavior of abuse. He's kind to her one minute, cruel the next. When he's mean to her, he blames his behavior on her, and she accepts the fault as her own. He stalks her, eavesdropping on her conversations and watching her while she sleeps every night. He gets angry and jealous, even threatening, whenever she speaks to any other boy, and she must keep reminding him that he's the only one she cares about. He slowly takes control over her life, convincing her to not drive anymore (for her own safety), deciding when and how her father should learn about him and meet him, and stating that he doesn't want her to be away from his side, ever. Yes, he's a vampire, and we can explain some of this away within the context of the story. But I wonder what it's like for someone who's ever filed a restraining order to read this book.<br><br>And I guess that's why my heart breaks for all the teenage girls who read this book and love it. If someone can make a feminist argument for Bella I'd love to hear it, but in my opinion she's a depressing excuse for a protagonist, filled with self-loathing and seemingly incapable of doing anything for herself. (Except cook!) Any girl who identifies with Bella (and there is plenty to identify with), or wishes she could be Bella, deserves to set her sights so much higher. <br><br>That said: I think adults have a tendency to overemphasize the effect any one particular piece of art can have on younger minds. When I was a teenager I owned the G N' R Lies album,  and although the music appealed to me then, I managed to grow up into a person who recognizes the misogyny of "Used to Love Her" and the homophobia and xenophobia of "One in a Million."  But I didn't become that way because adults told me I shouldn't listen to that album, and who knows how that would have turned out, if it'd become something I felt I needed to dig my heels in over. <br><br>There's something beyond value, something universally humanizing, in the act of getting lost in the world of a book or a movie or an album, especially when you're a teenager. If millions of people are experiencing that with Twilight, than I want them to have that. It's good for humans, it's good for books, and it's good for the universe. I'll just hope that later on they'll also give themselves to chance to get lost in the worlds of girls like Willow Rosenberg, Listen Taylor, Frankie Landau-Banks, and Tally Youngblood.</span>

Oh yes.  Illustrated as much as I could manage, but some things just aren't possible.<br><br><u>10.  Eating fish custard is much cooler than drinking blood.</u><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681105.gif" class="escapedImg"><br>Here's the thing: vampires are old hat now.  And by 'now' I don't just mean in the wake of the craze Twilight itself created.  I mean that there was already an adult PNR before this book even came along.  Vampires, drinking blood, all that stuff - been there, seen that, and seen it better.  Now, Timelords are a different thing.  While Who is the second longest-running TV show <em>in the world</em>, it never gets dull.  (I choose to ignore Love and Monsters for purposes of this review.)  Vampires, no matter how many 'new takes' you have on them, do.  Heaven knows I roll my eyes a bit now, and I've read a lot of different ideas about them.  I would have liked this book ever so much more if Edward and his family had been some sort of original creature.  Also, that would have required more work of Ms. Meyer, and more work might have produced a better final work.<br>Also, fish sticks and custard are much tastier than blood.  Just sayin'.<br><br><br><br><u>9.  Eleven looks amazing with a bow tie.</u><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681106.jpg" class="escapedImg"><br>(Don't deny it, he does.)<br>The real point of this is: the Doctor actually acts like an old-fashioned gentleman.  In every sense of the word.  Sure, Edward holds car doors for Bella.  But he still invades her privacy and watches her sleep, and he still takes advantage of her hormones.  The Doctor, on the other hand, has class.  He is infallibly polite, except to his enemies, and let's be honest: would you be polite to xeoncidal alien races?  Thought not.  He doesn't invade his companions' privacy.  He doesn't take advantage of Amy's hormones, even when she makes it reeeeeally easy.  And sure, some of that is because he's awkward around women.  Some of it, though, is because he's been around long enough to learn some goddamn manners.  Edward could do with a few lessons.<br><br><br><br><u>8.  He has mad dance moves.</u><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681107.gif" class="escapedImg"><br>And he's not afraid to show it.  My point here is that Eleven has a genuine <em>personality</em>.  He has interests that don't relate to the females in his life.  He has his own goals unrelated to them; he doesn't dote on them (though he does care for them); he isn't full of happy coincidental interests.  Inasmuch as Bella has interests, Edward shares them.  The rest of his time and mind power is pretty much spent on her.  Excuse me while I gag - okay, all better.<br>Also, Edward doesn't seem to me like he knows how to have fun.  Seriously.<br><br><br><br><u>7.  He's Space Gandalf.</u><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681108.gif" alt="Photobucket" class="escapedImg"><br>This goes back to the personality thing, and also the not getting boring thing.  I mean, how could Edward describe himself?  He calls himself a monster a few times - wonderful, very sexy, loving the self-hate - and he's popularly called a sparklepire.  Now, let's look into these.  Space Gandalf pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the Doctor: very, very old, very wise, very powerful, kind and self-sacrificing, and more concerned with the big picture.  What do we learn from the world 'sparklepire'?  Well, that he sparkles... and he's a vampire.  The 'monster' thing tells us he's emo.  <br>Bottom line being:  the Doctor is much more interesting than Edward.  Much, much, much, much more.<br><br><br><br><u>6.  He has a much cooler ride.</u><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681109.png" class="escapedImg"><br>Do you know what that little thing in the left corner is?  It's the <em>U.S.S. Enterprise</em>.  Remember how huge that ship is?  Yeah, it's drawn next to the full TARDIS structure to scale.<br>I'd take that over a silver Volvo any day.  <br><br><br><br><u>5.  He'd rather travel space and time than watch sappy movies.  </u><br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681110.jpg" class="escapedImg"><br>Edward makes most of his goal in life to 'keep Bella safe'.  And he does so by not letting her really live it up.  The Doctor, on the other hand, owns up to the fact that his life is dangerous - and then offers to take people with him anyway, because he has faith in their personal strength.  Edward treats Bella like a hapless child.  The Doctor, to whom the entire human race can be rather childlike, treats his companions like adults.  He doesn't assume the worst of them, but the best.  He is a positive force, whereas Edward uses his supposed fear of Bella getting hurt to keep her where he wants her - and acts as a source of negativity in that way.<br><br><br><br><u>4.  He defeats his enemies with words alone.</u><br>For this I have not a picture, but a video:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arAjbSkKF-Q&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>Edward has to use physical force to tear his opponents apart, and then he has to set them on fire.  All the Doctor has to do is talk them down.  Is there any question who's more badass here?  Because if there is, newsflash: true badassery comes not from being the most violent or physically forceful thing around, but from being so determined and unstoppable that no one even wants to engage you in a fight in the first place.  <br><br><br><br><u>3.  He is clearly better at attracting women.</u><br>This:<br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681111.gif" class="escapedImg"><br>or this?<br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681112.gif" class="escapedImg"><br>First off, Amy is hotter than Bella could ever be.  But that's not all.  Bella, as I kinda mentioned above, has little to no personality.  She hates Forks.  She likes Jane Austen.  She's apparently smart, though she doesn't act that way.  She mothers her own father, and she's SO IN LOVE with Edward.  Amy?  Amy is curious even as a young girl.  She has a sense of wonder.  She is tenacious - just ask those four psychiatrists who tried to tell her the 'Raggedy Doctor' wasn't real.  She has a powerful, persuasive personality.  She loves Rory, and she makes it clear that she doesn't want to live without him, but not everything in her life is about him.  Most of all, she saves the Doctor and herself several times.  Locked up by aliens?  Pick locks and break the hell out.  Good friend about to walk the plank into shark-infested waters?  Grab a cutlass and save his life.  And yeah, she doesn't always make the right choices, but at least she does things.  Partly, Bella's problem with not doing jack comes from the fact that the people she would have to fight are a trillionbajillion times stronger than she is, but partly it's because she's a wuss.  Amy has drive, goals, curiosity, desires beyond being with her man forever.  She, unlike Bella (and this drives me APESHIT on Bella's side) actually values her friends.<br>If I got in a fight and I had Amy Pond and Bella Swan with me, I'd toss Bella to whoever we were fighting and then do my best to kick ass as well as Amy would.<br>Also, it bears noting: someone goes creeping in Amy's house and she hits him over the head with a cricket bat and handcuffs him to a radiator.  Someone goes creeping in Bella's house and she thinks it's smexy.<br><br><br><br><u>2.  He can rock a fez.</u><br><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841r/681113.gif?141545886927559" class="escapedImg hostedImg" data-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841r/681113.gif" style=";display:none;" data-error="[image error]" onerror="$j(this).loadHostedImage();" onload="$j(this).loadHostedImage();"><img src="/assets/loading-trans.gif" class="escapedImg loadingImg"><br>There's no deeper meaning to this one.  Just - look at Eleven in that short-lived fez, and then look at Edward in the same sort of headgear:<br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681114.png" class="escapedImg"><br>Yeah.  NO.<br><br><br><br><u>1.  He saves the whole world, not just one pathetic girl lacking survival instinct.</u><br>When the guy tops io9's list of characters who've saved the world the most, you know he pwns everyone else.<br>However.<br>This is also a matter of scale.<br>I mean, Edward is pretty much immortal, right?  And he's all strong, fast, able to read minds, etc.  So why isn't he doing something for the greater good?  Yes, yes, can't go outside in sun because he sparkles, I know, but there are other things he could do.  He's been through high school and college quite a few times; couldn't he be working on a cure for cancer?  Or genetically engineering crops to fix world hunger?  Or in some way actually <em>contributing</em> to the planet?  See, you can tell me that Edward Cullen is a good guy, but the fact is he's a pathetic little coward who hides in his corner of the world and refuses to use his gifts to help the rest of the planet and those who are suffering.  As for the Doctor, his whole mission in life is to help the world.  In one season, he saved the world four times.  FOUR.  TIMES.  He manages to see both the big picture and the small picture, both the personal crises and the lives that need changing and the massive invasions or conflicts.  He is not a coward.  He does not hide.  He fights his own battles and he <em>wins</em>.<br>Want to convince me that Edward is a hero?  Put him on the big stage and show me his shine.  (or his sparkle, I suppose.)<br><br><br><br>I should note that while I hated Robert Pattinson as Edward for many reasons, I won't bear him permanent ill will unless he screwed up Water for Elephants.  I do like making fun of his portrayal of Edward, and I find him distinctly unattractive.<br><br>In conclusion:<br><img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380223841/681115.jpg" class="escapedImg"><br><br><br><br><br>Original review:<br><a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[The first time I read it, I liked it.<br>The second time, which directly followed the first, I liked it.<br>Then I took some time off to catch up on the rest of the series.  <em>New Moon</em> had me up until two in the morning (though in my own defence I read a chapter of it, a chapter of <em>Silent Spring</em> the whole time).  Later, at camp, finding a friend reading it, I borrowed it and flipped straight to one scene to re-read it, just 'cause.<br><em>Eclipse</em> was okay, and I was fine with <em>Breaking Dawn</em> on first go-through.  (Another all-nighter, on principle this time.)<br><br>My problem with Twilight is much less its story (though the sparklepires are dumb beyond expression) and much more its fanbase.  It does not deserve this screaming, plauge-of-locusts-like fanbase.  Hell, no book deserves that- and this is coming from someone guilty of rabid fangirling, so no grain of salt required.<br><br>Eventually, when I've run out of good new things to read, I'll get back to Twilight and give it the thorough, mostly unbiased review all books deserve.  I will not read Cleoland before reviewing.  I will not read Cleoland before reading.  I will not even <strong>touch</strong> Ferretbrain.

After all, any 14-year-old virgin swoons over the hot guy who manages to be dangerous while safe, evil while angelic, hot while humble, overbearing while sensitive, sexy while sexless, etc. In other words, a guy who doesn't exist in any form, anywhere, ever. I'm trying to figure out the messages we're sending to young girls when we give them guys like Edward Cullen and support the idea that he's somehow "dreamy". 1) he's not human, 2) he's controlling and possessive, 3) he's a member of the army of the living dead who doesn't want to have sex because.....of his....morals.....<br><br>I'm really tired of the moral preachings in YA romance fiction, and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight" title="Twilight by Stephenie Meyer">Twilight</a> takes it to a level all its own because we're dealing with moral dilemmas and religious dogma in a book <em>about vampires</em>. Don't have sex before marriage, girls. Even if your dream guy turns out to be a soulless, blood sucking minion of hell. That doesn't mean you should let him get the milk for free. If he likes it, he'll put a ring on it, all that jazz. Let's brush aside the fact that I am a strong proponent of sex education and <em>not</em> shaming girls for their sexuality...even if I were a strong believer in waiting until marriage (I think you can guess I'm not), I <em>still</em> wouldn't understand this book. She's dating a fucking vampire. No, scratch that because Bella's a spineless imbecile, <strong>Edward Cullen is a fucking vampire who won't have sex with his girlfriend</strong>. It just doesn't make sense. Until you realize it was written by a Mormon. Then it makes so much sense, in such a chilling way.<br><br>I'll admit I was roped in by this book at first. I actually sort of liked it. Time heals all wounds, however, and two years and many more books later, the poison has left my body. </span>

So, move aside, Jack London.  In acknowledging my friend Ms. Meyer’s role in developing this new tradition, I feel like the first important thing to say is that Stephenie Meyer is not The Man.  While most criticisms of the Twilight series are empirically true, it is nevertheless also true that this series is ubiquitously influential in culture right now, and I don’t think it’s influential in the same way as the War on Terror, or even Sarah Palin.  The War and Palin are both The Man in ways that I refuse to believe Ms. Meyer is.  I do concede, however, that Stephenie Meyer is a polished and packaged <em>product</em> of culture, and that she is the same package, in almost every way, as me.  I don’t care about age or cynicism, I am the audience for this book.  If you want to see my reaction summed up much more quickly than I plan to, I refer you to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/77689799">Paul Bryant’s Georgia </a>.  To introduce you more thoroughly to the audience for whom this book was written, I’ll start with a little summary of the story.<br><br>Bella arrives, at the opening of the story, in the small town of Forks, Washington, and she’s not thrilled.  She’s like, <em>A little town, oh, it's a quiet village - ev'ry day like the one before.  Little town full of little people, waking up to say, bonjour!</em><br><br>She checks in at school, which is awkward because everyone’s staring and whatnot.  They’re all, <em>Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question, dazed and distracted, can't you tell?  Never part of any crowd, 'cause her head's up on some cloud.  No denying she's a funny girl that Bella.</em><br><br>Even her father doesn’t really get her and goes around thinking, <em>Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar.  I wonder if she's feeling well.  With a dreamy far-off look and her nose stuck in a book, what a puzzle to the rest of us is Bella!</em><br><br>Even when she makes friends, they still just don’t understand that she’s an old soul – too old for dances and shit like that.  Everyone still wants to be her friend, though, and they go around whispering, <em>Look there she goes a girl who's strange but special, a most peculiar mad'moiselle.  It's a pity and a sin, she doesn't quite fit in, 'cause she really is a funny girl – a beauty but a funny girl.  She really is a funny girl – that Bella!</em><br><br>If, after that brief summary, you don’t have a very particular song (and maybe some dance moves that you made up to go with the song at one time or another in your life) stuck in your head, then you are not the designated audience for <em>Twilight</em>.  I’m not even intending to be disrespectful or critical when I say that the resonance people feel with <em>Twilight</em> is the resonance of Disney.  It is the dividing line between those who fall in love with this story, and those who can’t stand looking at the cover art.  Interestingly, though, I think most of the people who cringe at the mention of <em>The Twilight Saga</em> would still go see a new Pixar movie or even <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> if it was re-released on the big screen.  It’s got the candlestick and the teacup, right?  Who doesn’t like to see inanimate objects sing and dance?  It’s just awesome.  Disney, however, is totally The Man.  Disney is, like, whatever is above The Man telling The Man what to do.  I would call it The Superman, but I don’t want it to get a big head.<br><br>Disney is smoother than <em>Twilight</em> because it knows that you can’t just present the story of a young, beautiful girl falling in love with a potential abuser without including a catchy tune and some dancing flatware.  In that way, I guess it’s a mixed blessing that the movie version of <em>Twilight</em> is so freaking boring and awkward.  It gives you time to reflect on whether it’s not a little convenient that our girl thinks it’s so groovy to have a vampire stalk her in her own bedroom.  It lets you stop and think that undying for love might not be all it’s cracked up to be.  The book version has lots of sparkles, though, and cars flying in every direction, so you don’t have to dwell on the unfortunate implications of the central relationship unless you’re inclined to.  But, let’s face it, most of us have contemplated that at one time or another.  If you haven’t, now’s your chance.  What do you think about a cartoon that encourages little girls to stay in abusive relationships because underneath the gruff exterior of the abuser lies the heart of a prince?  What do you think about a book that has women across the country swooning at a cadaverous stalker watching a teenage girl sleep?<br><br>I’ll tell you what I think: it totally doesn’t bother me.  I mean, if those aren’t the implications that the storytellers were intending (and I don’t necessarily think they are), then <em>oops!</em>, but that’s the extent of my criticism.  On the other hand, I think it’s equally possible that those are the implications that the storytellers intended, and, if so, they are both pretty effective in being persuasive and single-minded in their goals.  The messages might be sugar-coated, but they’re still obvious.  They’re not sneaky or underhanded.  I don’t like it when I feel like an author is trying to sneak around with themes, but if I just disagree, it’s not so bad.  I think they’re good stories, too, despite their unfortunate messages, and they are made all the better by their singing and sparkles.  Whether we like it or not, stories that idealize stalking and teach girls to try reforming their abusers through patience and fancy dresses are deeply ingrained in (at least) Western culture.  It seems possible that these stories are even products of a conflicted nature in humanity.  Men want the virgin/whore; women want the beast/god.  But, also, none of us really want those people because they’re freaky.  We don’t know what we want.<br><br>(Arguably, the moral of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is that looks aren’t everything, and the moral of <em>Twilight</em> is that true love waits.  I think those are less interesting messages within the stories, so I’m not going to address them.  They are obviously there, though, so disagree as you wish.)<br><br>Maybe there is a little Harold Bloom in all of us, mentally applying for the role of literary gatekeeper every time we read a book we don’t like.  I have read criticisms of <em>Twilight</em> that are both hilarious and poignant, and, like I say, this book has a very specific audience.  When I hear criticisms, though, they usually just make me really sad.  A girl I know is a mother of three young kids and lives out in the middle of nowhere.  At the time she read <em>Twilight</em> she was mostly staying home (again, in the middle of nowhere) and being a mom.  She hated the book and had two criticisms.  First, she thought that the clothes were really dorky (and, it’s true, the clothes are distracting).  Second, every time she looked at Stephenie Meyer’s picture on the back, it bugged her because she thought about how Meyer is “just a mom,” as though a mom shouldn’t have a valuable voice in literature.  <br><br>I hate that on a lot of levels.  I hate the idea of limiting literature to what I agree with, and I hate the idea of taking the voice of moms out of any part of culture.  It also seems like a creepy excuse for nonparticipation to say that an entire group of people, to which you belong, shouldn’t be respected in the literary world.  I’m not trying to say that Stephenie Meyer represents all moms, but I do think that a lot of criticism I have read of her writing either dismisses her as The Man or as a mom.  It reflects the idea that literature should be a table at which only the cool kids sit – or at which the cool kids can’t sit.  I don’t know who’s supposed to sit there.  <br><br>There are a lot of totally valid reasons to dislike any book.  I recognize this book’s faults, but I think that one of its greatest strengths is that it was written by a mom.  I think it is a fun, hilarious, action-packed story.  I think that Stephenie Meyer has story-telling skillz and that you can’t teach that.  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/159.Henry_James" title="Henry James">Henry James</a> might have had a big vocabulary, but he couldn’t tell a story to save his life.  Ms. Meyer could benefit from reading the dictionary once or twice, but she already has what you need if you find yourself sitting around a campfire.  Possibly, she could use just a dash of self-awareness, but too much self-awareness can ruin any good story – just look at <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3371.Dave_Eggers" title="Dave Eggers">Dave Eggers</a>.  Honestly, I would rather be brave enough to write <em>Twilight</em> than smart enough to criticize it.<br><br>It’s funny to say, but this book actually inspired a real crisis of faith in my life.  I’ve had some occasions where I’ve had major fallings out with God and then other occasions where I’m a big fan – like ya do.  A crisis of faith is not unusual for me.  There’s this thing that goes down in mainstream Christianity that is really annoying (I’m sure it happens in other religions, too, but I’m talking totally pop culture Christianity here so that my point makes sense).  It’s this thing where people will frame a story as though the hero’s dreams are sure to fail, but then, suddenly, through the power of prayer, God swoops down and fixes everything in a magical money donation.  Don’t get me wrong; magical money donations are the bomb.  But does that mean that for those whose magical money didn’t come through, God’s showing that he’s angry with them?  Does God speak in a reward/punishment system?  I don’t think so, but I don’t really know anything about it.  I know that in that situation, you’re supposed to say that God has a better plan, but that lacks something to me, also.  To be clear, this isn’t a criticism that I’m making of religion in general, or even of Christianity in general, but of this Disneyland Christianity that is everywhere in America.  It’s a religion of total convenience where everything has a vague, cliché explanation and, if it doesn’t, we don’t look at it.  And the way people tell these stories is like they’re telling the plot of the newest movie about a down-and-out kid’s sports team.  The stories are all informed by the plot development of Disney movies.<br><br>Like this Disney filter, Edward and Bella’s relationship is very convenient.  Edward is immortal and can give immortality.  He watches over Bella.  His desire for Bella is consuming both physically and emotionally.  Bella’s maturity alienates her from other humans.  She is physically vulnerable.  She is smart and values passion over care for her life.  Edward is the Disney god and Bella his disciple.  I really don’t mean to be disrespectful when I say I’ve heard God and His people described just this way many times.  I don’t know why I hadn’t really thought about this before I read <em>Twilight</em>, but from thinking about the silly convenience of the Edward/Bella relationship, a lot of real things fall apart for me.  Like, if we believe that God is really real (not just abstractly real) and we think that God is with us all the time like Edward is with Bella, why isn’t that creepy?  I know I think it’s creepy with Edward, but why not with God?  I think it’s because we believe God is there when we’re thinking about Him and not when we’re not.  I think Jesus has become a sparkly, romantic immortal with super-strength who thinks you’re so awesome he can’t take his eyes off of you and gives you cars sometimes.  This is obviously a problem, but I think any generation will interpret traditional writings through a contemporary cultural lens, so it’s not shocking.  It’s just, perhaps, not the lens most of us would prefer.   <br><br>On the other hand, if we think we’re completely alone when we aren’t with humans, no possibility for anything supernatural or spiritual, that seems limited and conveniently clean, too.  I don’t have an answer, and it seems like it’s not really possible to have an answer that’s not annoyingly convenient on some level.  <br><br>Also, I'm not saying this because I think Stephenie Meyer invented the Disney Jesus, but because I think it helps explain <em>Twilight</em>'s resonance in society.  I think Meyer expressed something very simple that both culture and religion have prepared people to receive.<br><br>It is probably important to say, again, that I’d be surprised to find out that Stephenie Meyer is part of a vast conspiracy to subdue Western civilization by reducing our worldview to clichés.  Plus, I think that when someone’s worldview is a cliché, patronizing them out of it isn’t really the way to go (yeah, you know who you are.  No, not you – you in the back.  That’s right).  Also, what do I know?  Maybe, Jesus really <em>is</em> sparkly and has a warehouse <em>full</em> of new cars.  It is just as legitimate to say that I don’t believe that because I don’t want to as that someone else believes it because they do want to. *sigh*<br><br>This may seem backwards, but I started reading Twilight in the mood for something fun and silly and not well written, and so I enjoyed (almost) every minute of the series.  In a more anti-Disney mood, I probably I would have wanted to burn them for the weak and whiny heroine and glorification of stalking.  <br><br>I think of these books like the show <em>Friends</em>, though.  Everything works out well for everyone by the end of the episode, and so despite appalling personal choices and caricatured personalities, the stories are comforting.  I don't know whether I think it's worse to be comforted by stories that present unhealthy worldviews, or to expect books to represent literal reality.  Both seem suspicious, but the first seems more fun.  I appreciate and think it's hilarious that Meyer loves her characters so much that she'll sacrifice anything in the plot to make things turn out well for them.  I never feel like she is trying to impress me, but only writing what she wants have happen.<br><br>The main criticism I hear of these books is that the love story is completely unrealistic.  This is absolutely true, but it is also a series about vegetarian vampire superheroes, so I think it's important to have a little perspective about realism.  I hope that we are not so culturally bankrupt as to go to <em>Friends</em> for dating advice or vampire stories for authentic representations of love.  Unfortunately, we actually might be that bankrupt, and I sadly acknowledge my own experience with teen girls and grown women taking these books VERY seriously.  I am reluctant, however, to be angry with books I thought were so silly and fun only because of other people being silly in a not fun way.<br><br>To conclude, I’m planning to petition Tim Burton to do a song-and-dance version of the <em>Twilight</em> movie.  It will be awesome.  For the vampires, we will cast <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j31g77LhBBo&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">all professional dancers</a>, and for the normals we’ll cast normals.  I mean, we gots a meadow scene, fast cars, and a baseball scene in here!  Not to insult the <em>My Dinner With Andre</em> version, but my version is going to kick ass.  We’ll throw in a little irony, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XH3oMNKApI" rel="nofollow">music up the melodrama</a>, and show the haters what a story looks like.  You’ll love it.</span>

I have a similar opinion to you, in that I feel the hate for this book has gotten completely out of control. Yes, it's not a shining example of feminism. Well, neither are a million other examples of YA lit and even classic literature. Futhermore, it's about VAMPIRES falling in love with HUMANS. Not realistic? Hummm, no I would say not. And anyone who continues to take this series to heart and hopes to extract lifelong relationship advice from them... Well, I think that person needs a reality check.</span>

  <span id="freeText9041236929577805398" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">I got a pre-emptive notice regarding this book from my older sister-in-law. I thought it was too funny not to share:<br><br>"I read this book because (13 year-old) had been told it was such a GOOD book. She read it and really liked it. So then I read it and the rest of the ones in the series. As a mother I had a couple of "issues" with this book. It is very romantic and they talk a lot about being SO in love. I had to explain to her that men do not talk like that. Second of all, he should NOT be spending the night with her - even if nothing happened. Third of all, just because he is trapped in a 17 year old body, he is still 80+ years old. Why would he be so attracted to her? I enjoyed the book, but as a mature 40+ year old, I can see it for what it is - a fun, good read. I worry about all the young teen girls who read this and think this is what and how love is. I hope they have someone to help bring them down to earth. It would be nice if love were really that great and men expressed them selves so freely, and you could always feel that pitter-pat in your heart, but from my years of experience it's just not like that. Sorry to dash your hopes - maybe it's like that for you. Enjoy the book and the others that follow. It was a quick fun read, though."<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>I found that these books speak to that teenage heart hiding deep within my "tainted by the real world" exterior and I get great enjoyment out of going back to that part of me that I miss a great deal.<br><br>I relate to the main character in the story "Bella" she is an awkward teenager who doesn't always see herself as others see her and has a hard time seeing why "Edward" the drop dead gorgeous vampire would want anything to do with her. True, the boy I loved in high school wasn't a drop dead gorgeous vampire, but he was beautiful to me and took my silly teenage heart for granted and walked all over it, but that's enough about him for now.<br><br>So here I go on my views and a few things I would like to address:<br><br>~*~*~<br><br>“It is very romantic and they talk a lot about being SO in love. I had to explain to her that men do not talk like that.” <br><br>About this book being very romantic and all the talk about being SO in love - well - It hasn't been too long since I was a teenager myself ..... <br><br> As a young teen girl that is "what and how love is". Saying "that's not love" is one thing, but to a teenager that is IT. I have volumes of poetry and stories that I have written on this exact topic. Go to any teenager and they probably have the same.<br><br>As a teenager I believe that we feel/felt things more deeply and experienced more in those few short lived years of our life the I think we ever will again. I loved more deeply/lustfully/openly/truly/vibrantly in my 3 years of high school then I have any day since then, and before anyone gets all offended I will clarify that REAL love, ETERNAL love and the SECURITY of love shared with a spouse or family or friends is completely different, but no less true or electric.<br><br>No, in real life men don't talk like that, but sometimes the men in our heads do. Who hasn't had a conversation with a man in their head and every word that came out of his mouth was sweet and romantic and full of feeling and truth? I'm sure most women have. Just because the men we are with on a daily basis don't talk like that it doesn't mean we don't want them to. :)<br><br>“Second of all, he should NOT be spending the night with her - even if nothing happened.” <br><br>The ways of LDS youth are not always the ways of the world, and just because the book was written by a former BYU student doesn't mean that the pages need to be dripping with gospel doctrine and perfect morals. That's Jack Weyland's job. She was writing a book for large publication where in a lot of places and to a lot of people this morality is the norm. <br><br>When I was 17 I spent the night with a boy - nothing happened, we shared a twin-sized bed at a sleep over where one of the only reasons I went was because it was his sister, at his house. Was it right? probably not. Did anything happen? he kissed me. Did my parents know? they do now. Do I feel guilty about it? no. Am I the only LDS girl who has ever done this? Absolutely not. Does that make a difference? no. Does this make me a bad person? No. Face it. Teenagers do things because we can and because we want to, not because our parents tell us to.<br><br>“Third of all, just because he is trapped in a 17 year old body, he is still 80+ years old. Why would he be so attracted to her?”<br><br>Yes, he's a vampire. Yes, he's 80 + years older then her, but is it more appropriate for that said vampire to date a 17 year old or should he bee looking to the older women in the 40 + still looking like a 17 year old? Just because he'll live forever doesn't make him any less needy then the rest of us and perhaps his body and his feelings are stuck in that perpetual 17 year old state. (why am I defending a fictional character?!)<br><br>"It would be nice if love were really that great and men expressed themselves so freely, and you could always feel that pitter-pat in your heart, but from my years of experience it's just not like that."<br><br>Eventually we all grow up. Even though this book gives the illusion of "what love is" and that teenage girls will believe it ... Eventually we all grow up. What is the harm in believing that maybe somewhere this kind of love is possible and that the person you choose to spend eternity with will love you deeply and electrically and unconditionally? Shouldn't that be how life is? That's how I love my soul mate, it's not always perfect, but it is deep and true and I hope it stays that way.<br><br></span>

That’s not exactly every man’s idea of date bait – unless they’re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that’s just the kind of guy Sookie’s been looking for. Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"13927525243739752380\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'8_book_140077\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"kPZCmjbc0oFfUhcTgA8Sw7EoVZqwXvTqgfdD3ewq0PLPgRvBl1VLI2Fl6pQ0Ntz/07YzQcubzHOy2QzK46qI+Q==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"140077\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"8_book_140077\" />\n<input id=\"wtr_new\" name=\"wtr_new\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"true\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_search\" name=\"from_search\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" id=\"ref\" name=\"ref\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\n<input class=\"wtrExisting\" id=\"existing_review\" name=\"existing_review\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"NAf6YLu669c1uxKhAfkrQH+uhG6NY+Ns2rwo3UwPjUVrcKM7GjNydQuM7ya1wOV8HTDitfam2/XpkmfKQ4/VTg==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"8_book_140077\" />\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"140077\" />\n<input id=\"a\" name=\"a\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

R. Ward’s “different, creative, dark, violent, and flat-out amazing” Black Dagger Brotherhood series continues as a vampire warrior crosses the line between life and death…into a world of dark dreams and darker desires.\n\nEver since the death of his shellan, Tohrment has been a heartbroken shadow of the vampire leader he once was. Brought back to the Brotherhood by a self-serving fallen angel, he fights again with ruthless vengeance, unprepared for a new tragedy. Seeing his beloved in dreams—trapped in a cold, isolated netherworld—Tohr turns to the angel Lassiter to save his former mate. The only way to rescue her is for Tohr to love another.

Not only does school mean daily interaction with preppy pest Trevor Mitchell, but her sleep-filled days and romantic nights with her immortal boyfriend, Alexander, must come to an end. Plus the shock of morning classes isn\'t the only change in store.  An unexpected letter turns up at Alexander\'s mansion�announcing his parents will be coming to town. And once they arrive, just about everyone has had a sighting of the macabre couple except Raven. What could be delaying Alexander from introducing Raven to them? Could Alexander be hiding something about his parents\' homecoming?  When Raven is finally invited to the most thrilling dinner party of her life, the next turn of events could transform her entire future with Alexander. The sixth book in Ellen Schreiber\'s bestselling Vampire Kisses series takes an unusual twist in the continuing romance of Raven and Alexander. <\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"16381358278292611078\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'12_book_5111039\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"xesS4SeIWHrzBQj0PI+mNyCrKddu7SiqTtpyZ+4S0lianEu6hgHB2M0y9XOItmgLQjVPDBUoEDN99D1w4ZKKUw==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"5111039\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"12_book_5111039\" />\n<input id=\"wtr_new\" name=\"wtr_new\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"true\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_search\" name=\"from_search\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" id=\"ref\" name=\"ref\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\n<input class=\"wtrExisting\" id=\"existing_review\" name=\"existing_review\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"0EVPukvaI8KHHI49XV19wvG7m21Yb6G+peJZ/N5IL9GPMhbh6lO6YLkrc7rpZLP+kyX9tiOqmSeWzBbr0ch32g==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"12_book_5111039\" />\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"5111039\" />\n<input id=\"a\" name=\"a\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

I swore it was like I could hear Robert whispering in my ear: The world of the dead won\'t give you up a second time. Just before the light completely vanished, I saw Dimitri\'s face join Lissa\'s. I wanted to smile. I decided then that if the two people I loved most were safe, I could leave this world.\n\nThe dead could finally have me.\n\n\nRose Hathaway has always played by her own rules. She broke the law when she ran away from St. Vladimir\'s Academy with her best friend and last surviving Dragomir princess, Lissa. She broke the law when she fell in love with her gorgeous, off-limits instructor, Dimitri. And she dared to defy Queen Tatiana, leader of the Moroi world, risking her life and reputation to protect generations of dhampir guardians to come.\n\nNow the law has finally caught up with Rose - for a crime she didn\'t even commit. She\'s in prison for the highest offense imaginable: the assassination of a monarch. She\'ll need help from both Dimitri and Adrian to find the one living person who can stall her execution and force the Moroi elite to acknowledge a shocking new candidate for the royal throne: Vasilisa Dragomir.\n\nBut the clock on Rose\'s life is running out. Rose knows in her heart the world of the dead wants her back...and this time she is truly out of second chances. The big question is, when your whole life is about saving others, who will save you?\n\nJoin Rose, Dimitri, Adrian, and Lissa in Last Sacrifice, the epic, unforgettable finale to Richelle Mead\'s international #1 bestselling Vampire Academy series.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"6545617688756336766\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'15_book_6527740\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"c7E1gXGmpN7GRmYS1Gm3nQ0flFANXZ1ZV+c6q5TJWZosxmza0C89fPhxm5VgUHmhb4Hyi3aYpcBkyXW8m0kBkQ==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"6527740\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"15_book_6527740\" />\n<input id=\"wtr_new\" name=\"wtr_new\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"true\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_search\" name=\"from_search\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" id=\"ref\" name=\"ref\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\n<input class=\"wtrExisting\" id=\"existing_review\" name=\"existing_review\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/vyD1Ann5Swh6A/kSVB2Jft+HgYRTKyAjnAuqZEFzZChi9qPqG58jh/f8mP9abgZmeB43WqJlBm9XmG+noWVmw==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"15_book_6527740\" />\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"6527740\" />\n<input id=\"a\" name=\"a\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

Hurtling us into a realm of seduction and shadows, Karen Marie Moning tells the enthralling tale of a woman who explores the limits of her mysterious powers as she enters a world of ancient sorcery—and confronts an enemy more insidious than she could ever have imagined.\n  \n  \nHe calls me his Queen of the Night. I’d die for him. I’d kill for him, too. When MacKayla Lane receives a torn page from her dead sister’s journal, she is stunned by Alina’s desperate words. And now MacKayla knows that her sister’s killer is close. But evil is closer. And suddenly the sidhe-seer is on the hunt: For answers. For revenge. And for an ancient book of dark magic so evil, it corrupts anyone who touches it.Mac’s quest for the Sinsar Dubh takes her into the mean, shape-shifting streets of Dublin, with a suspicious cop on her tail. Forced into a dangerous triangle of alliance with V’lane, an insatiable Fae prince of lethally erotic tastes, and Jericho Barrons, a man of primal desires and untold secrets, Mac is soon locked in a battle for her body, mind, and soul. As All Hallows’ Eve approaches and the city descends into chaos, as a shocking truth about the Dark Book is uncovered, not even Mac can prevent a deadly race of immortals from shattering the walls between worlds—with devastating consequences.…<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"34786344385822363\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'20_book_2702704\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"n9JuB2rn6TQRjViUlEJn1wL4AyD5fI1n5mHe4+N/kPnApTdcy25wli+6pRMge6nrYGZl+4K5tf7VT5H07P/I8g==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"2702704\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"to-read\" />\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"20_book_2702704\" />\n<input id=\"wtr_new\" name=\"wtr_new\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"true\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_search\" name=\"from_search\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input class=\"wtrLeftUpRef\" id=\"ref\" name=\"ref\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"\" />\n<input class=\"wtrExisting\" id=\"existing_review\" name=\"existing_review\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" action=\"/shelf/add_to_shelf\" class=\"hiddenShelfForm\" method=\"post\"><div style=\"margin:0;padding:0;display:inline\"><input name=\"utf8\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"&#x2713;\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/1/7BwDcOxqB+djBYToOPwxYrGNsdqT2Y4z087ZF5zWgKKJcoVWiuL/OJUbVA8ADbsbKuBeznG9QorvkucW/Pg==\" /><\/div>\n<input id=\"unique_id\" name=\"unique_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"20_book_2702704\" />\n<input id=\"book_id\" name=\"book_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"2702704\" />\n<input id=\"a\" name=\"a\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" type=\"hidden\" />\n<input id=\"from_choice\" name=\"from_choice\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"from_home_module\" name=\"from_home_module\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"false\" />\n<input id=\"book_origin\" name=\"book_origin\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"related_works\" />\n<input id=\"page_url\" name=\"page_url\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"/book/show/41865.Twilight\" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

  <span id="freeText7916942021089163874" class="elementTwo" style="display:none">I was born in Connecticut in 1973, during a brief blip in my family's otherwise western U.S. existence. We were settled in Phoenix by the time I was four, and I think of myself as a native. The unusual spelling of my name was a gift from my father, Stephen (+ ie = me). Though I have had my name spelled wrong on pretty much everything my entire life long, I must admit that it makes it easier to google myself now.<br>I filled the "Jan Brady" spot in my family-the second of three girls. Unlike the Brady's, none of my three brothers are steps, and all of them are younger than all the girls. I went to high school in Scottsdale, Arizona, the kind of place where every fall a few girls would come back to school with new noses and there were Porsches in the student lot (for the record, I have my original nose, and never had a car until after I was in my twenties). I was awarded a National Merit Scholarship, and I used it to pay my way to Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah. I majored in English, but concentrated on literature rather than creative writing, mostly because I didn't consider reading books "work" (as long as I was going to be doing something anyway, I might as well get course credit for it, right?).<br>I met my husband, Pancho (his real name is Christiaan), when I was four, but we were never anywhere close to being childhood sweethearts. In fact, though we saw each other at least weekly through church activities, I can't recall a single instance when we so much as greeted each other with a friendly wave, let alone exchanged actual words. This may have been for the best, because when we did eventually get around to exchanging words, sixteen years after our first meeting, it only took nine months from the first "hello" to the wedding. Of course, we were able to skip over a lot of the getting to know you parts (many of our conversations would go something like this: "This one time, when I was ten, I broke my hand at a party when-" "Yeah, I know what happened. I was there, remember?") We've been married for ten and a half years now, and have three beautiful, brilliant, wonderful boys who often remind me chimpanzees on crack. I can't write without music, and my biggest muse is, ironically enough, the band Muse. My other favorite sources of inspiration are Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Coldplay, The All American Rejects, Travis, The Strokes, Brand New, U2, Kasabian, Jimmy Eat World, and Weezer, to mention a few.</span>
